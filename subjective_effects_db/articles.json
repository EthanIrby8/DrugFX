Our team members are volunteers.[/i][/p]\n\n[p]A publicly-funded United Kingdom center for learning research published a 2011 meta-analytical systematic review of 838 studies. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"1\" /]  It illuminated a stark problem in investigating particular styles of learning experiences. There is a substantial detriment to the field of education due to the conceptual confusion from having no set-defined vocabulary to draw from.[/p] \n\n[p]EffectIndex is in the unique position of [int-link to=\"/effects/\"]having developed a vocabulary[/int-link], since 2011, to comprehensively describe the nature of experience and behavior under the influence of psychotropic substances. For both researchers and clinical populations, improving communication is crucial in emerging studies on psychotherapy.[/p]\n\n[p]These are scientifically-supported therapy principles and techniques designed to be easily understood by the general public. Even in the absence of hallucinogens, applying these skills to modify automated dysfunctional cognitive processes can be as effective as lone pharmacological treatments or the entire collection of cognitive behavioral therapy instruction.

Impaired emotional processing significantly impairs the ability to make decisions. [ref to=\"6\" /] Effective emotion regulation requires combining the experience or expression of emotion with the ability to actively change emotion. [ref to=\"7\" /] Skills in identifying, labelling, and making sense of the information an emotion provides are essential.[/p]\n\n[p]Western cultures tend to have the view that emotions are polarizable, for example feeling only happy versus feeling only sad.[ref to=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" /] A 2015 meta-analysis of 63 studies indicates that mixed emotions can be reliably detected, feeling happy and sad at the same time.[ref to=\"10\" /] Hoemann, K. et al. suggest that brains generate a singular emotion product with a large number of dimensions, as opposed to multiple fundamental emotions in parallel.[ref to=\"11\" /] Recognizing these dimensions, in terms of blending positive and negative emotions together, is strongly associated with good physical health.[ref to=\"12\" /] Blending emotions also lessens typical age-related health declines.[/p]\n\n[p]The term for holding seemingly contradictory positions at the same time is [b]dialecticism.[/b] Many modern therapy approaches (ACT, CBT, FAP, ICT, MBCT, SARP) overtly emphasize dialecticism. They simultaneously push for [i]acceptance[/i] of behavior and [i]change in behavior[/i]. This guide will focus on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a more personalized extension of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). [ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Furthermore, Dialectical Behavior Therapy demonstrates effectiveness for a wide variety of neurological disorders.[/p]\n\n[h2]Acceptance[/h2]\n\n[p][b]It's a mistake to think acceptance is so naturally part of who we are that no training/practice is required.[/b] Immediately offering advice on what needs to change can increase emotional intensity which can legitimately lead to extreme behavior and emotional dysregulation. [ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] Communicating understanding of where someone is standing on an issue—validation—reduces emotional intensity and cues an adaptive response. Active, disciplined, and precise validation is required to motivate emotion regulation and create the conditions for change.[/p]\n\n[p]DBT defines validation as empathy plus the communication that the perspective is valid in some way. Nonverbal expressions are often more powerful than explicitly verbal ones.[/p]\n\n[h3] Validate a behavior's [/h3]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/validating%20behaviors.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"1183\" /]\n\n[br /]\n[h3] Levels of Validation [/h3]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/validation%20pyramid.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"1183\" /]\n\n[p]Validation strategies teach the recognition of emotion and cue the expression of that emotion. [b]Bringing attention to an emotion signals the body's physiological response. The trick is to articulate what emotional dimensions are valid in a response.[/b] Validating a difficult, avoided emotion increases contact with that emotional experience. This can strengthen abilities in accepting emotional experiences. Bringing disconnected emotional states together may be vital for adapting emotions into effective responses.[/p]\n\n[p]Don't fake understanding and relating with people. Rescuing people from experiencing sadness or despair through a bait and switch may communicate nonacceptance, which raises dysregulation. Primary emotions—those first flashes of response—are like a spotlight. When there is clarity, they are naturally used to solve problems. [i]Emotional processing takes time[/i], but it can be helped by striking the right balance between expressing compassion, support, and providing explicit next-step direction.[/p]\n\n[p]The overall dilemma is that invalidation is necessary to communicate what is ineffective and what does not make sense. Practitioners must be open to what is valid without reinforcing dysfunctional behavior. The same response can be valid and invalid at the same time. For example, self-harm is remarkably dysfunctional (invalid); however, given that it may produce relief from unbearable emotions, it is valid as a means to effectively regulate emotions.[/p]\n\n[p]DBT's main idea is to help others experience emotions without maladaptive coping. It's guided by exposure therapy principles. Emotional competence will increase through widening emotional awareness, increasing tolerance for painful emotion, and preventing behaviors that function as an escape. For trauma, using validation to direct attention towards a sense of control and diminishing the sense of isolation may be more helpful than leaning into the emotional experience.[/p]\n\n[p][b]Establishing trust and understanding comes before recommending solutions.[/b] Be precise about what you are validating. Invalidate the invalid nonjudgmentally, describing how a response doesn't make sense or doesn't work. Keep an eye out for self-invalidation. You don't need to walk on eggshells when you can genuinely, with empathy, describe what is valid and what is invalid.[/p]\n\n[h2] Change [/h2]\n\n[p]Change can be invalidating, which intensifies emotional dysregulation, so it's important to frequently reiterate why a task is important. Understanding behavior change is important for everyone because treatment providers and social networks often unintentionally reinforce dysfunctional behavior.[/p]\n\n[h3] Exercising Metacognition - Creating Maps [/h3]\n\n[p]DBT manuals suggest the technique of creating a behavior map. The map specifies the targeted behavior, the behaviors leading up to it, and the consequences of the target behavior. For unwanted behaviors, it recommends changing something in the web of behaviors leading up to it. This practice is called Behavioral Chain Analysis, Behavioral Activation, or Concept Mapping. It’s an observably successful therapeutic method with its mechanisms in the skills of personal awareness, otherwise known as metacognition.[/p]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49737797371_897d20bf20_o.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"1183\" /]\n\n[p]In the scientific literature on education, multiple meta analyses consider metacognition as either the most or the second most effective strategy to increase knowledge transfer and retention. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"16\" /] [ref to=\"17\" /] [ref to=\"18\" /] When comparing 556 studies to 1772 studies, the addition of metacognitive learning components clearly outperforms a simple presentation of information for understanding/use. Concept mapping reliably produces gains in critical thinking abilities [ref to=\"19\" /] and improves central ideas with no loss of knowledge gained elsewhere. It's multisensory (verbal \u0026 visuospatial) and adds reflection brain processes on top of retrieval. High-ability and older students also benefit more from this practice when measured across a large range of education levels and subjects studied.[/p]\n\n[p]The authors cautiously suggest the overall benefit may be due to greater learning engagement rather than the properties of concept maps as an information medium. [b]Creating maps with pre-constructed materials cause the observable benefits to disappear.[/b] Generally, there are better results creating maps where meaning is signaled by node proximity, shape, and color.[/p]\n\n[h3]Interfering Aspects and How to Deal With Them[/h3]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49746987713_db871b5917_o.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"1183\" /]\n\n[p]Problem Based Learning (PBL) has strong positive effects for increasing efficacy in acquiring skills. [ref to=\"18\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"20\" /] More recent meta analyses report students gain somewhat less knowledge, but this is a trade-off. PBL emphasizes elaborating the principles that act as the links between concepts. [ref to=\"20\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"21\" /] [ref to=\"22\" /] Elaboration demonstrably creates an easier recall of knowledge and greater skills in application/inference. [ref to=\"23\" /] PBL does not, however, significantly affect critical thinking skills.[/p]\n\n[p]To reduce the amount of time it takes to do a task, a 2013 meta analysis of 289 studies suggests small breaks are specifically tailored for this. [ref to=\"24\" /] When measured over the range of seconds to a month-long break, a 2006 meta analysis of 184 studies found generally a 15 minute to one day break encourages the highest retention of information. [ref to=\"25\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Dialectical Behavior Therapy helps clarify the if–then effects of behavior; behavior rehearsal is essential. Participants learn to observe/describe their own style of thinking and their underlying assumptions. They notice when their cognition is ineffective, and confront their problematic thoughts so that they may create a more functional or dialectical sense of truth. The main aim is not to blitzkrieg a problematic thought organization. The main aim is to weave a subtle cognitive change informally throughout with a strong emphasis on intuitive knowing that combines both rational and emotional responses.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h1] Additional All-Use Techniques and Strategies [/h1]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49751597781_1ec38caa9f_o.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"551\" /]\n\n[h2]Effective Learning[/h2]\n\n[p][b]The brain distributes neural activity.[/b][ref to=\"26\" /] Cognitive functioning exists as self-sustained cyclic patterns of activation, otherwise known as neural networks.[ref to=\"27\" /] Regions implicated creating associations, processing environments, and memorization are all notably highly interconnected.[ref to=\"28\" /][/p]\n\n[p]The Left-Brain/Right-Brain hypothesis emerged due to a misinterpretation of brain scan images, believing ‘hot spots’ as isolated functional units. These ‘hot spots’ are set by arbitrary thresholds in statistical mapping. There is not any rigorous neuroscientific evidence in favor for stability in hemisphere-based individual differences. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"3\" /] [ref to=\"26\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n\n[p]Multiple intelligences are not particularly useful due to the brain’s processing complexity. Higher oversimplification creates higher inaccuracy/imprecision. [ref to=\"26\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n\n[p]There is no robust evidence for efficacy in designing instruction towards specific learning styles. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"4\" /][/p] \n\n[h3]Variety Outperforms Monotony[/h3]\n\n[p]Learning preferences still exist, but presenting instructional material in a multisensory format is distinctly more advantageous for learners.[ref to=\"1\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"26\" no=\"3\" /][ref to=\"29\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Meta analyses point to better learning performances when:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li]Unconventional teaching methods are explored, like a lack of lectures (2016, 8 studies for nursing students) [ref to=\"19\" no=\"2\" /][/li] \n  [li]Social and emotional education are presented alongside material (2011, 213 school-based interventions) [ref to=\"30\" no=\"1\" /] [/li]\n  [li]Learning strategies vary (1986, 84 studies on vocabulary instruction) [ref to=\"31\" no=\"1\" /] [/li]\n  [li]Tests are in mixed format or multiple choice (2017, 118 studies) [ref to=\"32\" no=\"1\" /] [/li]\n  [li]Instruction is a blend of online and face-to-face instruction, rather than purely one or the other (2009, 176 studies) [ref to=\"33\" no=\"1\" /] [/li]\n[/ul]\n    \n[h2]Emotional Processing[/h2]\n[h3]Mindfulness[/h3]\n[p]A 2013 meta-analysis examining 209 studies suggests mindfulness-based therapy is more effective than psychological education, supportive therapy, relaxation procedures, and imagery/suppression techniques. [ref to=\"34\" no=\"1\" /] It is particularly effective for reducing anxiety, depression and stress. [/p]\n\n[p]Mindfulness is another practice of metacognition. It is clinically defined as nonjudgmentally observing phenomena that enters an individual’s awareness, such as perceptions, cognitions, emotions, or sensations. [ref to=\"35\" no=\"1\" /] These are observed carefully but are not evaluated as good or bad, true or false, healthy or sick, or important or trivial. It's bringing one’s complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis.[/p]\n\n[p]This skill is primarily practiced through meditation, optionally with audio guidance. Substances that induce time distortion and ego death may aid this process.[/p]\n\n[p]Different meditative practices increase gray matter in different parts of the brain. [ref to=\"36\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[captioned-image src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49754641993_62807c4cfb_o.png\" align=\"center\" artist=\"Graham\" width=\"1183\" /]\n\n[p]The important consequence of mindfulness practice is the realization that most sensations, thoughts, and emotions fluctuate, or are transient, passing by “like waves in the sea”.[/p]\n\n[h3]Positive Psychology[/h3]\n[p]2019 and 2017 meta analyses of meta analyses advise that positive psychology intervention effects are overestimated by the current scientific literature. [ref to=\"37\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"38\" no=\"1\" /] Across more than 50 meta analyses, there are small to moderate positive effects on mental well being, and mood. [ref to=\"37\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"39\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"40\" no=\"1\" /] Reductions in depression, stress, and negative emotions are hit-and-miss. [/p]\n\n[p]The effectiveness of this type of intervention increases with age. [ref to=\"37\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"41\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"42\" no=\"1\" /] Interventions in children show very little results. [ref to=\"43\" no=\"1\" /] Post-college aged adults show the highest effect sizes. Though regardless of age, self-compassion and the active process of forgiving are endorsed as a few of many factors to reliably improve psychological well-being. [ref to=\"44\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"45\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"46\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]There is no true 'one size fits all' method for positive interventions, and gratitude does not necessarily produce unique outcomes. [ref to=\"37\" no=\"3\" /] The takeaway here is that the prevailing scientific evidence advocates positive psychological interventions to increase cognitive well-being and optimism. [ref to=\"47\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"48\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[h3]Art Therapy[/h3]\n[p]Systematic reviews for art therapy find observable reductions in depression, anxiety, symptoms of trauma, distress, and improvements in mood, coping, and some aspects of quality of life. [ref to=\"49\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"50\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"51\" no=\"1\" /] These results need to be taken with a grain of salt due it always being in combination with psychotherapy and the limited number/low quality of randomized controlled trials.[/p]\n\n[p]Art therapy encompasses any creative output such as drawing, sculpting, painting, music, drama, or dance. It enables distancing and integration of emotion while stimulating meaning-making processes. Substances that enhance creativity may aid this process.[/p]\n\n[h3]Being in Nature[/h3]\n[p]A 2019, 2015 and two 2014 meta analyses suggest contact with nature has a small to moderate significant effect on improving positive emotions, decreasing negative emotions, and sustaining improvements for self-reported mental health, general health, and personal growth. [ref to=\"52\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"53\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"54\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"55\" no=\"1\" /] Substances that induce the feeling of unity and interconnectedness may aid this process.[/p]\n\n[h3]Being Alone[/h3]\n[p][b]Newcomers should not be alone.[/b] Hallucinogenic substances enhance the intensity of emotion. There is the chance for currently felt negative emotions to become all-encompassing, also known as 'having a bad trip'.[/p]\n\n[h3]Expressive Writing[/h3]\n[p]A 2006 meta analysis of 146 studies suggests writing has a modest but observable beneficial effect on overall functioning. [ref to=\"56\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"57\" no=\"1\" /] Its benefits are more related to processing emotions (distress, depression, positive functioning) than to cognition (schemas, dysmorphia). [/p]\n\n[p]In controlled studies, it is more effective for people to write in private and keep their writing to themselves. Expressive writing provides a means of expressing and processing emotions that avoids the barriers and/or the negative consequences that may accompany sharing. [b]PTSD patients who shared their writing with a group had worse emotional and physical health outcomes 5 weeks later.[/b] [ref to=\"58\" no=\"1\" /] Other studies using expressive writing with PTSD patients did not show negative effects. Thus, the authors concluded that sharing with the group may have been the cause of the negative effects. [/p]\n\n[p]Even a single writing session can provide benefits. The best outcomes tend to appear with at least three 15 minute writing sessions a week spaced a few days apart. Writing about positive experiences is just as beneficial as writing about negative ones. Switching topics does not make a difference. [/p]\n\n[p]As a side-note, with temperance, the highest learning benefits are suggested to result from individuals studying maps and mixed groups creating maps. [ref to=\"16\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"17\" no=\"2\" /] Studying maps outperformed studying outlines/lists. Creating maps outperformed reading text, attending lectures, and class discussion.[/p]\n\n[h1]Using Groups: The Benefits of Teaching[/h1]\n[p]A 2009 meta analysis of 176 studies and a 2001 meta analysis of 122 studies show that using collaborative material greatly outperforms working independently. [ref to=\"59\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"60\" no=\"1\" /] The 2009 analysis indicates a five-fold increase in learning compared to working independently, which offered little to no benefit at all. The key advantage is allowing students to share and debate their ideas. Both contesting ideas⁠ (exposing flawed reasoning⁠) and learning eachother's perspectives enrich overall understanding. [ref to=\"61\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"62\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Peer teaching does not necessarily differ from faculty teaching either, according to a 2016 meta analysis. [ref to=\"43\" no=\"2\" /] Acting as a tutor increases teaching skills, academic achievement, and positive attitudes for the taught subject. [ref to=\"63\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"64\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Teachers reinforcing directly related material in short-duration structured programs—with mnemonic devices, graphic organizers, and mental imagery techniques—generate the strongest effect on learner performance. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"6\" /] [ref to=\"17\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"64\" no=\"1\" /] Learners also perform better with extra feedback and low irrelevant cognitive load. [ref to=\"65\" no=\"1\" /] Enacting a group strategy creates even greater positive effects, although the effect sizes are highly related to the social environment. [ref to=\"60\" no=\"2\" /][/p]\n\n[h2]Tripsitting[/h2]\n[p]Tripsitting is the equivalent of babysitting. The sitter’s role is not to direct the trip, but rather to act as a supportive presence. They facilitate a comfortable exploration of altered consciousness. [b]Effective tripsitters must understand [int-link to=\"/substances/\"]the possible subjective effects[/int-link] that may arise to be able to communicate understanding/validation. [/b] [/p]\n\n[p]A 2007 meta analysis encompassing 355,325 students weighted teacher-student relationship variables. [ref to=\"62\" no=\"2\" /] As correlations, it suggests (in order) the most benefits are derived from: [/p] \n[ul]\n    [li]Students initiating and managing their own activities, which gives a sense of ownership and control over the learning process [ref to=\"62\" no=\"3\" /][/li]\n\n    [li]An empathic climate emphasizing the perception of care. Gestures of support differ from physical exploitation. It's important to have strong, established physical boundaries because psychedelics may kindle romantic, codependent, or otherwise confusing feelings during the trip. [62][/li]\n\n\n    [li]Fostering a warm and acceptant environment focused on internal motivations. Both people and surroundings greatly influence a psychedelic experience. Teachers honoring students' voices encourages genuine trust. [ref to=\"61\" no=\"2\" /] [ref to=\"62\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n\n\n    [li]Encouraging higher order thinking. The highest transferable person-centered variables are critical and creative thinking. Teachers must encourage learning, thinking, and growth-centered beliefs. It's also beneficial to be familiar with spiritual/metaphysical disciplines due to the transpersonal nature of psychedelic states, [ref to=\"62\" no=\"5\" /] [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n\n\n[p]Research on the effectiveness of communication skills training is embedded in research on behavioral marital therapy, prevention training, and parenting interventions. [ref to=\"66\" no=\"1\" /] Even with some noted publication bias, a 2005 meta-analysis of 30 studies suggests behavioral marital therapy is better than the absence of treatment. [ref to=\"67\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]Communication problems are seen as excesses and deficits in specific types of behaviors. [ref to=\"68\" no=\"1\" /] The basic strategies for teaching communication skills are typical in behavioral skill training: instruction, modeling, behavioral rehearsal, and feedback. Couples are encouraged to be genuine and make direct statements of their desires. Blame, an indictment of guilt, is discouraged and acknowledging one's own contribution to the problems are encouraged. Good communication skills focus on the topic at hand and do not interrupt nor use extreme terms such as \"always\" and \"never\". They highlight positives and focus on the present when problem solving; they avoid applying stagnant labels and coercive messages. [/p]\n\n[p]A more in-depth look at communication models can be found here and here.[/p]\n\n[h3]Small Groups: 1-3 Individuals[/h3]\n[p]Small groups outperform individuals, individualized instruction, and large groups. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"24\" no=\"2\" /] The main beneficial effects are on achievement, persistence, and attitudes. [ref to=\"60\" no=\"3\" /] [ref to=\"61\" no=\"6\" /] The social context moderating effect sizes is greater, but small groups consistently produce better products and more gains in each respective individual's knowledge. For learning outcomes, mixed groups creating maps outperformed reading text, attending lectures, and class discussions. [ref to=\"16\" no=\"3\" /] [ref to=\"17\" no=\"3\" /][/p]\n\n[h3]Large Groups: 3+ Individuals[/h3]\n[p]Groups of three to five also outperform individual learning. [ref to=\"60\" no=\"3\" /] However, groups larger than five with no specific cooperative learning strategy fail to significantly benefit individual achievement. This finding is especially relevant for exploratory environments and the creation of tools for other tasks.[/p]\n\n[p]Group cognitive therapy is generally as effective as individualized treatment. [ref to=\"69\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"70\" no=\"1\" /] [ref to=\"71\" no=\"1\" /] Psychoeducational groups reduce relapse/rehospitalization, essentially acting as harm-reduction. [ref to=\"72\" no=\"1\" /][/p]\n\n[p]An inherent risk exists that group members may engage in coruminating behavior. An unfocused excessive discussion of problems without knowledgeable guiding information has potentially harmful effects on group members' functioning. [ref to=\"72\" no=\"1\" /] The sharing of negative experiences in the absence of a structured environment may promote coping and social skills that increase the frequency of negative thoughts and feelings, subsequently decreasing functional behavior.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2] Bibliography [/h2]\n\n[p]Blewett, D.

Through the power of expecting an action or task to work, almost anything is possible within the dream-space and this can allow for some truly incredible experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]The most common of these activities and the techniques used to engage in them are listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 1\" header=\"Enhancing clarity and detail\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dream is blurred and low in clarity or detail, it is possible to enhance and improve these factors by verbally stating aloud \"[i]enhance visual clarity[/i]\" or another similar statement and simply expecting it to work.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 2\" header=\"Spawning objects\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]If the dreamer wants to spawn objects such as vehicles, weapons, food, people, etc, this can be done through two different methods. The first is walking into a room and simply expecting to find the object in a particular location, and the second is drawing the vague shape of the desired object in the air with their hands while simultaneously verbally commanding the object into existence through expectant dialogue such as \"[i]a jetpack is going to appear in front of me.[/i]\" The more specific the verbal request is, the more accurately the object is to fit the dreamers intentions when it spawns.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 3\" header=\"Travelling to new locations\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]If the dreamer wants to travel to a new location, there are two methods through which this can be done. The first of these is to spawn a door by drawing its shape in the air while stating clearly where they would like it to take them before walking through it. An example of this would be the statement \"[i]this door is going to take me to my childhood home[/i]\".[/p] \n\n[p]The second technique is to verbally state where they would like to visit while simultaneously spinning around in circles. Once they have stopped spinning, they should find themselves in the desired location. The more detailed the verbal request, the more accurate the outcome is likely to be.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 4\" header=\"Flying\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]There are different styles of flight that people use, each with a varied level of success depending on the individual. Methods such as swimming through the air as if it were water, “Superman style” (one arm outstretched), “Airplane style” (both arms out), and \"Bird style\" (gliding through the wind, flapping one's arms to navigate air currents) are often used.[/p]\n\n[p]Regardless of the flight style, there are a few methods of getting up into the air, such as jumping or willing one's body to levitate. However, perhaps the easiest method of flight is to use a flying tool that the dreamer pre-emptively spawns in, such as a jet-pack or witches broomstick.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 5\" header=\"Shape-shifting\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]Many people try to shape-shift into animals, creatures, and other genders by willfully changing their body parts one by one. This is usually ineffective, as the body often changes back quicker than one can complete the process. A much more effective technique is to turn the transformation into an instant process by spawning a tool which will help one to transform. An example of this would be to spawn a magical transformation pill which can be swallowed or a magical wand which can be waved in order to instantly transform one into their desired form.[/p]\n\n[p]Another surprisingly effective shape-shifting technique is to posses the body of an already existing person, animal or creature. This can be done through the bizarre but simple method of climb into them from behind and wearing their body over one's own skin in a manner that is similar to that of a wet-suit.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 6\" header=\"Having sex\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Although it is potentially a somewhat taboo topic, many people learn to lucid dream purely for sexual reasons. This can often be unexpectedly difficult, as it is often very challenging to maintain lucidity during the act of dream sex and the chosen partner may even shift into an undesirable form part way through. However, in order to have sex within a lucid dream, all one needs to do is simply initiate it with a dream character.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 7\" header=\"Taking drugs\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]An interesting way to change the course of the dream is to ingest drugs which the dreamer may or may not have tried in real life. This will result in inducing a variety of unique and unexpected changes to the dreamers mood and perception, which may or may not line up with the effects which the real life substance actually induces.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Activity 8\" header=\"Eating food\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]Another great activity to engage in within dreams is the simple act of eating food. This is because the experience of eating food within a dream can feel and taste completely realistic, resulting in an extremely pleasurable experience which is genuinely very satisfying.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2]Alternative/Advanced techniques[/h2]\n[p]Outside of the more common and standard technique of habitually practicing reality checks in order to obtain lucidity within dreams, there are a number of advance and alternative techniques that can be used for similar purposes. Listed below are just a few of the most common advance techniques, each with links to more detailed tutorials that are hosted on other websites.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"FILD\" header=\"Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]FILD (Finger Induced Lucid Dreaming)[/i] is defined as the act of waking up from deep sleep in the middle of the night, before performing light repetitive movements with your fingers as if you were playing the piano with your index and middle finger, and then allowing the body to drift off to sleep while this action is being performed. This process usually lasts for several seconds to a few minutes, but if performed successfully it can allow the person to enter into a dream state while still remaining fully conscious.[/p] \n\n[p]A much more detailed instructional tutorial can be found within this article [ext-link to=\"https://www.thelucidguide.com/Techniques/Finger%2FFocus-Induced-Lucid-Dream-%28FILD%29]here[/ext-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"WILD\" header=\"Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]WILD (Wake Initiated Lucid Dream)[/i] was coined by Dr. Stephen LaBerge, a psychophysiologist who specialized in the study of dreams. It is used to refer to any lucid dream where the dreamer brings their woken awareness into a dream while falling asleep.

Identifying with specific \"external\" systems}The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus.

Identifying with all perceivable \"external\" systems}The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.\n\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.\n\nIt is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.\n\nHowever, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.\n\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.\n##md{### 5. Identifying with all known \"external\" systems}##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{#### Further reading}Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:\n\n##md{- **[Monism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics))** is a philosophical position which argues that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and it works together as a unified system of behaviour.\n- **[Dialectical monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism)** is a philosophical position which argues that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one but can usually only be experienced in terms of division.\n- **[Oceanic feeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling)** is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form.\n- **[Nondualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism)** is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self.\n- **[Alan Watts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts)** is a philosopher who spoke extensively about the illusory nature of the self.

It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.\n\nIt is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.\n\nHowever, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.\n\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.\n##md{### 5. Identifying with all known \"external\" systems}##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{#### Further reading}Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:\n\n##md{- **[Monism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics))** is a philosophical position which argues that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and it works together as a unified system of behaviour.\n- **[Dialectical monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism)** is a philosophical position which argues that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one but can usually only be experienced in terms of division.\n- **[Oceanic feeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling)** is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form.\n- **[Nondualism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism)** is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self.\n- **[Alan Watts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Watts)** is a philosopher who spoke extensively about the illusory nature of the self.

Users will start to experience blurred and double vision while anesthetic-like effects such as tactile numbness begin to take place. At this point, motor control, coordination, and balance become somewhat suppressed and mechanical in a manner that is partially compensated for by a feeling of the body being in \"autopilot\". In terms of sound, the sense of hearing also seems to become vague, muffled, and distant.[/p]\n\n[p]Accompanying these effects are a number of inconsistent and brief visual distortions that may occur spontaneously during certain dissociative experiences. These distortions can include alterations in perceived distances between objects, visual segmentation of one's vision into glitch-like cubes or slices, and changes to the perceived size of one's body or environment.[/p]\n\n[p]During this level, if one allows themselves to relax while closing their eyes, they may fleetingly find themselves drifting off into a darkened hallucinatory void filled with simplistic shapes, forms, and structures.

These structures are usually formed from solid materials which can take the form of any shape. However, common examples include vast and monolithic pillars, columns, tunnels, blocks, buildings, slides, monuments, wheels, pyramids, caves, and a variety of abstract or fractal shapes.[/p]\n\n[p]Depending on the dissociative consumed, the effect known as geometry may also occur to varying extents. However, it is worth noting that dissociative geometry rarely exceeds level 4 and is generally far more simplistic and colourless than that of its psychedelic counterpart.\nThis is the level at which the effects become powerful enough to render the person undergoing them as incapable of functioning, interacting normally, or thinking in a sober manner.

It is also found as a naturally occurring byproduct within a huge variety of plants and animals. The substance itself induces a brief but extremely intense psychedelic experience, alongside a disproportionate amount of hallucinatory content in comparison to other traditional psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and mescaline.[/p]\n\n[p]This article exclusively discusses DMT’s subjective effects. If you would like to learn more about DMT's chemistry, pharmacology, history, legality, and potential dangers, refer to its PsychonautWiki article [ext-link href=\"https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT\"]here[/ext-link].[/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Duration[/h2]\n[ul]\n[li][b]Total :[/b] 5 - 20 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Onset :[/b] 20 - 40 seconds[/li]\n[li][b]Come up :[/b] 1 - 3 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Peak :[/b] 2 - 8 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]Offset :[/b] 1 - 6 minutes[/li]\n[li][b]After effects :[/b] 10 - 60 minutes[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These durations only apply to DMT that is being smoked or vaporised. DMT is not active through oral ingestion unless an MAOI or an RIMA (such as syrian rue or B. caapi vine) is consumed approximately 30 - 60 minutes prior to DMT. This substantially changes the subjective effect profile of the compound, so much that it is usually discussed as distinct experience: “Ayahuasca” is DMT prepared for oral ingestion using traditional plant sources, while “pharmahuasca” colloquially refers to preparations made with crystalized DMT or psychiatric MAOIs.[/p]\n\n[p]Besides vaporizing and oral ingestion, less effective (and consequently less common) routes of administration include insufflation, rectal suppository, and sublingual absorption. In clinical settings, DMT is typically administered intravenously, which can allowed for a prolonged immersive hallucinatory state. Recreational intravenous use is also uncommon as it requires medical equipment, training, and pharmaceutical-grade DMT.[/p]\n\n[p]The duration of a DMT trip seems to progress through four separate stages of experience that each feel distinct. At heavy dosages the user may find themselves progressing through all of these stages in sequence, while low-dose experiences may skip over stages 2 or 3. These stages are described and documented below.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Taking off\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The first stage of a DMT trip is the onset, which leads into what is commonly referred to as \"breaking through\".[/p]\n\n[p]As the user smokes DMT, effects typically begins with the sudden onset of distinct [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-enhancements\"]visual enhancements[/int-link], which are immediately followed by high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and a [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]warm tingling sensation[/int-link]. At higher dosages, the user may find the pipe that they are using to smoke their DMT has transformed into an incomprehensible mass of geometry that is quite difficult to put down or hand off to someone nearby. There may also be [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory hallucinations[/int-link] that resemble soft crackling. For example, some users report an extended tone that quickly rises in volume and pitch, as the intensity of [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] also increases.[/p]\n\n[p]This sound (which is replicated above) typically becomes all-enveloping and abruptly ends as one of several different “take off” variations are experienced. These include, but are not limited to:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li]Increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link], which becomes so all-enveloping that the visible environment is completely blocked out and replaced.[/li]\n[li]Feelings of being suddenly pushed through – and onto – the other side of a membrane.[/li]\n[li]The environment forming into a geometry-filled tunnel, which the user moves into as it widens and subsequently encompasses their entire vision.[/li]\n[li]The environment splitting into separated sections, leaving a gaping chasm filled with high-level geometry, as the user separates from their body and is then catapulted directly into it at a high speed.[/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]This process of \"taking off\" typically occurs within the range of about 30 seconds to a minute, and leads directly onto the second stage of a DMT trip.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 2\" header=\"The Waiting Room\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Almost immediately after a person has smoked enough DMT to “[i]take off[/i]”, they sometimes find themselves spending approximately 10 - 30 seconds in what is often described as a psychedelic “[i]waiting room[/i]”. It can take on any appearance, but most commonly presents itself as a tunnel, room, or space that is comprised of fast moving [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]In fact, this \"waiting room\" feels distinctively different from the main bulk of the trip to such an extent that it has led many DMT users to speculate that it is potentially some sort of psychedelic loading screen, during which the upcoming trip is being generated and planned out by the subconscious mind.[/p]\n\n[p]After “taking off”, the person will usually transition into the most impressive stage of the experience. However, in certain cases the user may feel stuck within the waiting room, and may even experience hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] suggesting that they are not yet ready to proceed past it. It is also important to note that although still relatively common in its occurrence, the waiting room is the least consistent stage of a DMT trip, and many users will never experience it all while simply finding that their DMT trips skip over it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 3\" header=\"The Other Side\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]Once the waiting room stage is either finished or skipped over, the user will feel that they have broken through into what is commonly referred to as the \"other side\". It is here where an incredibly wide variety of potential hallucinatory content can manifest itself. However, this intensified stage will still usually follow somewhat consistent themes and archetypes that are reported by many people who experience the substance.[/p]\n\n[p]These themes generally consist of visiting a hallucinated alternate reality that is sometimes reported to feel \"more real\" than everyday life. In terms of their visual aesthetic, these hallucinatory spaces usually consist of incomprehensibly complex psychedelic [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that is condensed into [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]settings or scenes[/int-link]. Examples of DMT spaces include landscapes, fractalscapes, rooms, buildings, cities, tunnels, caverns, non-euclidean structures resembling a hive or nest, womb-like environments, and an infinite variety of potential others.[/p]\n\n[p]Within DMT spaces, there are often one or more [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link] within the user's perceived field of vision. These entities frequently act as if they have been waiting for the user's arrival, and are usually unphased by the person's sudden apparition. Upon noticing the user, DMT entities may enthusiastically greet them but reactions of surprise, indifference, or ambivalence are equally common. These entities may also convey a sense of urgency, as though attempting to demonstrate a multitude of incredible things during the short amount of time that they have before the effects of the drug wear off.[/p]\n\n[p]During these experiences, [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] may employ a variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity?s=communication-styles\"]communnication styles[/int-link], including: [i]spoken language, direct manipulation of the visual environment, choreographed movement, telepathy, beams of energy or information, visual languages, or any combination of these[/i]. Through means such as these, entities often seemingly attempt to either explain some message to the user, or provide a guided tour of some aspect of the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link] which they inhabit. The message often feels personalized and related to the user's life or emotional well-being, but can also contain aspects that seem entirely nonsensical or ineffable when removed from the context of the DMT trip.[/p]\n\n[p]These [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will often dubiously present themselves as all-knowing, and although they can take any visual form, some visual archetypes are more commonly experienced. These archetypes include [i]humanoids, aliens, elves, insectoids, giant spheres, beings of light, plants, jesters, maternal or nurturing guardians, and complex robotic machines[/i]. At this point it is common for the user (unless they are very experienced) to be completely overwhelmed by the DMT trip, despite feeling relatively clear-headed. This sometimes results in the entities encouraging the user to stay calm, not to give into astonishment, and to simply try to pay attention to what is happening.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are common, it is worth noting that these [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entity[/int-link]-filled [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link] do not necessarily occur for every person and are not entirely consistent in their manifestation between trips. A certain number of people do not seem to experience hallucinations at all, and instead simply find themselves engulfed in all-encompassing high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] during this stage of the DMT trip. Thus, the frequency with which any given user encounters entity-filled DMT spaces varies.[/p]\n\n[p]After 2 - 10 minutes of this experience, the DMT trip will begin to wear off while moving into its fourth and final stage.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Stage 4\" header=\"Coming Down\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]The final stage concludes the trip, with either the sensation of being pulled progressively further away from the [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], or the hallucinations becoming increasingly vague and ill-defined until imperceptible. During this process, the [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]entities[/int-link] will sometimes bid farewell and encourage the person to return if given the chance.[/p]\n\n[p]Once over, the user immediately finds themselves back in reality with strong level 4 - 5 visual [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] which quickly fades. Similar to how the content of a dream is forgotten upon waking up, detailed memories of DMT experiences also often rapidly deteriorate upon returning to baseline consciousness. This [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] can be counteracted by taking notes, recounting the trip to another person in detail, or recording a narration of the experience on audio or video.[/p]\n\n[p]As the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] becomes more mild and [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link] sets in, the user will often experience a sense of being [int-link to=\"/effects/physical-euphoria\"]bathed in euphoria and awe[/int-link]. The geometry typically persists for an additional 5 - 10 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving a strong [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations\"]body high[/int-link] that can persist for up to half an hour in extreme cases. This afterglow typically feels like a warm fuzziness throughout the body, and often leaves behind a sense of cognitive [int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]rejuvenation[/int-link], well-being, and mental clarity which can last for hours, days, or even weeks after the trip.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is worth noting that if the user has consumed a dosage that is not strong enough to reach stages two and three, then this experience of coming down will simply manifest as a progressive reduction of intensity without any of the aforementioned effects or details.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2]Intensity Scale[/h2]\n[p]This intensity scale breaks the subjective effects of DMT into six distinct levels, in which each level typically contains an expanding list of effects that generally intensify relative to the dosage consumed. The approximate frequency of occurrence is also listed alongside each effect. For an explanation of the terms used within this frequency measuring system, please see the article [int-link to=\"/effects/approximate-frequency-of-occurrence-scale\"]here[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although the dosages listed here are a useful average, it is important to keep in mind that the DMT dosage required to reach a particular range of effects varies between individuals depending on their body weight and respective neurochemistry.[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Subtle\" subHeader=\"2-10 mg\" labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]A subtle DMT experience is the level at which it first becomes apparent that the substance is producing effects. This is typically comprised of benign sensory and cognitive effects such as [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-amplifications\"]visual amplifications[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/categories/cognitive-effects\"]cognitive alterations[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]Although this experience is more distinct than a placebo, the substances effects may not demand the user’s attention and can be willfully ignored.

At higher doses, this geometry is significantly more likely to result in states of [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-inner-mechanics-of-consciousness\"]visual exposure to the inner mechanics of consciousness[/int-link] rather than a [int-link to=\"/effects/visual-exposure-to-semantic-concept-network\"]visual exposure to one's semantic concept network[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] induced by vaporized DMT is widely considered to be the most profoundly intricate and complex manifestation of this effect out of any and all psychedelic drugs. Compared to the [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry?s=variations\"]style of geometry[/int-link] produced by ayahuasca, the geometry appears more synthetic and digital in material composition, demonstrates colour schemes that are similar to those experienced on LSD, and has an organized geometric structure reminiscent of that produced by psilocybin.[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, spontaneous tactile sensations become pronounced and fully manifested. The [int-link to=\"/effects/spontaneous-tactile-sensations?s=variations\"]style variations of these bodily sensations[/int-link] includes [i]a constant duration, feelings of movement, gentle character, all-encompassing placement, and euphoric emotion[/i].

The user typically feels like they have broken through into the hallucinatory [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]DMT space[/int-link], as described above in the \"[i]other side[/i]\" section.[/p]\n\n[p]For most people, a strong dose of DMT will produce high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] more consistently than any other psychedelic. The style variations of these internal hallucinations is that they are usually [i]lucid in awareness, interactive, novel in subject, autonomous and non-controllable, and psychedelic in appearance[/i]. This is accompanied by other hallucinatory effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]sceneries and landscapes[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]narrative scenarios[/int-link]. These hallucinations can involve an endless variety of themes that may be personal, religious, spiritual, futuristic, magical, surreal, nonsensical, or transcendental in nature.[/p]\n\n[p]However, it is also worth mentioning that during the onset of this intensity range and above, the user will often experiences [int-link to=\"/effects/changes-in-felt-gravity\"]changes in their perception of gravity[/int-link] which commonly involve feelings of floating at extreme speeds either forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, or in an unspecifiable direction. This will usually stop once the user has reached their \"destination\" but will often continue at a much slower pace if the hallucination involves moving around within a specific location.[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are substantially less common than internal hallucinations, [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link] can also occasionally occur with heavy doses of DMT. These typically consist of a mixture of realistic and [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link]-based hallucinations of either real objects within the surrounding environment \"[int-link to=\"/effects/object-activation\"]coming to life[/int-link])\", the entirety of the environment changing in its visual character, or sudden apparitions such as the appearance of [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link]. The [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination?s=variations\"]style variations[/int-link] of these external hallucinations is [i]lucid awareness, an immersed viewpoint, novel subject matter, autonomous and non-controllable, and equally likely to be either realistic in appearance or comprised of psychedelic geometry[/i]. Although external hallucinations are more common under the influence of DMT in comparison to other psychedelics, they are still quite uncommon and may never be experienced even by regular users.[/p]\n\n[p]Despite intense hallucinations at this dosage range, the user will often still feel connected to their physical body even while traversing [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]hallucinatory spaces[/int-link]. Most users will  automatically close their eyes and allowing themselves to be immersed in the internal experience – however, if the user suddenly opens their eyes midway through the trip, they will likely leave the hallucinatory space. Upon interrupting their [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], the user will typically experience much less-intense [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-effects\"]visual effects[/int-link] with their eyes open. These effects typically include strong [int-link to=\"/categories/visual-distortions\"]visual distortions[/int-link] and highly complex [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] that almost completely cover the user's field of view. Upon closing their eyes again, the user may find themselves placed directly back into the same [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]hallucinatory scenario[/int-link], or they may simply experience high-level geometry while being unable to completely re-enter their internal hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]During less intense DMT breakthroughs experienced at this dosage range, many users report feeling surprisingly lucid and clear-headed in comparison to an equally-intense dose of psilocybin, mescaline, or LSD. However, the insightful and therapeutic cognitive effects that are heavily associated with psychedelic experiences are frequently either entirely absent or significantly reduced. This may be a result of DMT's extremely short duration, which does not allow the person much time to deeply contemplate or experience its cognitive effects.[/p]\n\nIf the user is inexperienced with psychedelic substances while undergoing this dosage range or above, they may find themselves experiencing [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link] and fear throughout the duration of the trip. This is not because DMT is inherently anxiety-inducing, but is more likely a response to being thrust into a profoundly complex, bizarre, overwhelming, and unfamiliar situation.

headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]An extreme DMT experience is the level at which the effects have become so powerful and pronounced that the person will typically be rendered unconscious and [amnesic](https://effectindex.com/effects/amnesia).[/p]\n\n[p]At this level, the person will experience the effects typically associated with the previously described heavy dosage during the brief few seconds of the onset and for up to several minutes during the offset of their trip. Throughout the peak they will simply [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link], black out, and become unconscious for a prolonged period of time that can range anywhere from 10 minutes to half an hour.[/p]\n\n[p]Although extreme psychedelic states may be attractive to certain individuals, it's important to consider that this level of intensity is both less therapeutic and explorative than the previous levels. However, it is also worth noting that when compared to extreme doses of other psychedelics, DMT is considerably less dangerous at this dosage range due to its extremely short duration and comparative lack of [int-link to=\"/categories/uncomfortable-physical-effects\"]intense physical side effects[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2]Personal commentary[/h2]\n\n[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\n[p]It would not remotely be an understatement to say that DMT is by far one of the most important and intriguing psychoactive substances in existence. The profound ease through which it can reliably transport the majority of people into incomprehensibly complex hallucinatory states is perhaps completely unmatched within the world of hallucinogenic compounds. However, it is because of these capabilities that this substance has developed a reputation which is surrounded by misconceptions and cultural mysticism that I feel the need to address within this section directly.[/p]\n\n[p]For example, the claims that DMT is released by the pineal gland during birth, death, and dreaming are entirely unfounded by the scientific literature. This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland.[/p]\n\n[p]In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards. In my opinion, it's not that normal sleeping dream states occur because endogenous DMT is being released, but that waking dream states are temporarily induced when dosages of DMT and other psychedelics are ingested which are strong enough to cause the specific subjective effect known as internal hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]My reasoning behind this is that there are some interesting commonalities between the behaviour of psychedelic induced hallucinations and dreaming that are too prevalent to discount as purely coincidental. For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people.[/p]\n\n[p]While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states.[/p]\n\n[p]Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits.[/p]\n\n[p]On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas.[/p][/quote]","length":34782,"parsed":[{"name":"captioned-image","properties":{"src":"/img/gallery/DMT.png","width":"350","caption":"N,N-Dimethyltryptamine molecule diagram.","align":"right","top":"true","border":"true"},"children":null},{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["This article is part of an ongoing effort to document the phenomenological effects of select psychoactive substances by applying comprehensive and formalized definitions from the ",{"name":"int-link","properties":{"to":"/effects/"},"children":["subjective effect index"]},"."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["This is initially being achieved by the ",{"name":"int-link","properties":{"to":"/profiles/Josie"},"children":["sites founder"]}," employing her first-hand knowledge of the subjective effects induced by hallucinogenic substances.

This idea was first popularised by the Richard Strassman's book \"The spirit molecule\" in which it was stated as pure speculation more so than as an evidence-backed theory. Although it is true that DMT is found in trace amounts within a vast number of plants and animals (including humans), there is absolutely no evidence that it is specifically produced by the pineal gland or that it is released in psychedelic amounts during certain situations. In fact, the current scientific consensus regarding the prevalence of DMT within plants and animals seems to suggest that it is most likely a byproduct of biological processes that are entirely unrelated to that of the pineal gland."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["In regards to the specific claim that the neurological mechanism responsible for dream states is due to the pineal gland releasing DMT during REM sleep, I think it is worth mentioning my position that the people who believe this have it completely backwards.

For example, the four-tier levelling systems which I have devised for both internal hallucinations and autonomous entity contact communication can both be applied perfectly to dreams and dream character communication in a manner which does not require any substantial changes to their descriptions. Alongside of this, the amnesia that is commonly experienced during the offset of a DMT experience behaves identically to that of the amnesia which is frequently experienced after waking up from a dream. Last of all and in a more subjective sense, the general feeling of a DMT hallucination feels very dreamlike to me and is commonly described as such by many people."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["While there are some apparent aesthetic and behavioural differences between that of psychedelic internal hallucinations and normal dream states, in my opinion, these can be accounted for by the simultaneous occurrence of other subjective effects alongside these high-level internal hallucinations. For example, the simultaneous experience of psychedelic geometry during a hallucinatory state seems to result in it appearing to be physically comprised of ever-shifting and incomprehensibly complex condensed geometric forms in a manner which gives them their well known \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. In terms of their behaviour, however, the simultaneous experience of an incredibly wide range of cognitive states such as ego death and various transpersonal effects seem to synergise and interplay with the specific effect of internal hallucinations in a manner which results in them displaying themes and concepts which would not ordinarily occur during normal dream states."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["Another even more outlandish although less common claim is that DMT literally transports the user's consciousness to an alternate dimension or higher plane of transcendental existence in which the autonomous entities are it's real and living inhabitants. While this idea has likely been around for as long as DMT has been used by human beings, it was seemingly popularised by Terence Mckenna and his recounts of visiting \"machine elves\" within what he claimed was a real space which legitimately existed somewhere outside of the human subconscious. From his perspective, McKenna hypothesised that the DMT was potentially an access point to a parallel universe, a tool through which extraterrestrials use to communicate with us, a space in which human beings from the future reside, or an afterlife which contains an \"ecology of souls\" of previously living and unborn ancestral spirits."]},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["On some level, I can definitely empathise with these perspectives as it is easy for me to see how a person could come to these conclusions given how absolutely incomprehensible and profound many DMT experiences can be. However, it is still worth noting that for a variety of different reasons, these conclusions almost definitely arise as a result of undergoing the DMT experience without a general understanding of occums razor, critical thinking, and scepticism.  While these various forms of misinformation may seem relatively harmless, I would argue that spreading them as fact is harmful to our community as it gives people the impression that psychedelic users are irrational proponents of pseudoscientific ideas."]}]}]},"authors":[{"$oid":"60542430198361300fea3610"}],"citations":[],"tags":[],"featured":false,"title":"DMT","subtitle":"broken down and described","publication_status":"published","slug":"dmt","created":{"$date":"2021-05-02T23:50:29.017Z"},"__v":0,"publication_date":{"$date":"2021-05-08T00:00:00.000Z"}}

A particularly ambitious form of meditation aims at effortlessly sustained single-pointed concentration[4] meant to enable its practitioner to enjoy a heightened sense of well-being while engaging in any life activity.[/p]\n\n[p]The word meditation carries different meanings in different contexts. Meditation has been practiced since antiquity as a component of numerous religious traditions and beliefs.[5] Meditation often involves an internal effort to self-regulate the mind in some way. Meditation is often used to clear the mind and ease many health concerns such as high blood pressure,[6] depression and anxiety. It may be done sitting or in an active way; for instance, Buddhist monks involve awareness in their day-to-day activities as a form of mind-training. Prayer beads or other ritual objects are commonly used during meditation in order to keep track of or remind the practitioner about some aspect of the training.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting, however, that despite the inconsistencies across cultural practices, universal techniques remain across all methodologies and this article will attempt to define and document these consistencies in a manner that is informative, rational, scientific and generally helpful for those who wish to pursue this deeply profound field of psychonautics. The biggest problem with defining a meditative technique is that there are many cultural and historical definitions which make different claims regarding the specifics of this subject.[/p]\n\n[p]In order to overcome these problems and document meditation as a whole, a simple and usable open source technique and set of information have been devised to define a generalized meditation methodology and its different components. The meditation technique will be presented in a manner that encompasses the culturally specific methods which are consistent across each other. This is with the belief that the subjective effects of the technique will be equal or greater in efficiency than other specific cultural practices.[/p]\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Mindfulness practice\" /][p]The most important and universal aspect of a meditative practice is mindfulness. This is a concept which is present in most if not all culturally specific forms of meditation in various forms usually consisting of the practice of some sort of self regulation. It can also be induced as a subjective effect by many psychoactive compounds, but is also primarily and formally something that can be consciously practiced and maintained through a set of specific actions or techniques.[/p]\n\n[p]It can be broken down into two distinct sub-components.[/p]\n\n[p]The first of these components involves the self-regulation of attention so that its focus is completely directed towards immediate experience, thereby quieting a person's internal narrative and allowing for increased recognition of external and mental events within the present moment. As thoughts come up, the practitioner returns to focusing on their present senses without developing the thought. This is repeated with the intention of quieting the mind.[/p]\n\n[p]The second component involves adopting a particular orientation towards one’s experiences in the present moment that is characterized by a lack of judgement, curiosity, openness and acceptance.[/p]\n\n[p]The average human being who attempts to quiet their thoughts will notice that their inner monologue will autonomously interject and distract one from the task at hand in a fashion which seems entirely uncontrollable. This is perfectly ordinary; as thoughts come up, a practitioner must passively notice that their mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way before returning the attention of their awareness into simply focusing on the present moment.[/p]\n\n[p]There are a number of techniques or tasks which people perform during this act of focus. These are practically universal and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 1\" header=\"Breath-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During the performance of this task as an act of meditation, attention is placed upon the movement of the abdomen when breathing in and out,[7] or on the awareness of the breath as it goes in and out the nostrils. The breath is noticed as it moves in and out as the body inhales and exhales. One should notice how the breath moves in and out automatically and effortlessly and should not try to manipulate it in any way. The details of the experience of breathing such as the feeling of the air moving in and out of the nose or the way the body moves as it breathes should also be noticed.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on breathing, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 2\" header=\"Mantra-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]This is perhaps the easiest form of meditative focus as it is harder to be distracted from than others.[/p]\n\n[p]During the performance of this task as an act of meditation, attention is placed upon the repetition of a repeated and outwardly spoken phrase of one's own choosing. This phrase can be anything such as simple counting, but it is worth noting that a phrase with personal significance is often most effective.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on repeating their mantra, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgmental way.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Technique 3\" header=\"Miscellaneous task-based focus\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]During this, mindfulness is intensively placed upon the act of upholding a task of any sort with varying levels of difficulty depending on what one chooses. This could include a range of things from walking, exercising, producing artwork, performing household chores, holding a conversation or any everyday task that one can think of. During this meditative focus, one concentrates on all of the senses available to them during it.[/p]\n\n[p]As thoughts come up, one returns to focusing on the task, passively noticing one's mind has wandered, but in an accepting and non-judgemental way.[/p]\n\n[p]A famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his MBSR program, is the mindful tasting and eating of a raisin.[8][9] Another popular example of task-based focus meditation is the practice of yoga.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Regular usage\" /][p]It is important to understand that unlike psychoactive substances, the effects and benefits of meditation are not instantaneous; they are accumulative in a manner which proportionally builds up with persistent repetitive practice over longer periods of time. For example, despite the initial impatience many people experience, a mediation routine of 10 - 60 minutes a day can drastically change one's default, sober day to day perspective in a profound and beneficial way. This is due to the way in which meditation induces persistent beneficial subjective effects throughout daily life.[/p]\n\n[p]It has been clinically demonstrated that those who begin 30 minutes of mindfulness mediation practice a day demonstrate detectable changes within their brain structure and report a number of positive effects involving memory, sense of self, empathy, stress, and overall well-being after eight weeks.[10] This demonstrates that even short-term periods of regular meditation have a clinically significant and measurable therapeutic effect on a neurological level.[/p]\n\n[p]Therefore, if one wishes to fully experience the changes in perception which meditation has to offer then they must maintain a persistent routine for as much and as long as reasonably possible.[/p]\n\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Position\" /][p]There are a multitude of positions which one can meditate with. These range from lying down or sitting to standing or walking. For personal usage, it is optimum to find a position which suits one best. Retaining a consistent position across sessions can allow one to associate this position with a meditative state and therefore assist in one's practice.[/p]\n\n[p]It is also worth noting that retaining a healthy upright posture throughout prolonged meditative techniques is extremely important and that if one is having trouble with this, they should consider moving to a comfortable chair. One should avoid lying down on a comfortable bed or similar surface. This is because doing so can result in sleep and therefore less efficient meditation.[/p]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/Meditation-poses.jpg\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\" /]\nAbove are a few potential meditation poses which one may find useful to try.\n[hr /][markdown text=\"### Guided meditation\" /]\n[p]There are certain people who practice meditation but prefer to use guided meditations. This is particularly true if the practitioner is inexperienced. The three audio files below contain examples of well-constructed guided meditation sessions which can be use to assist in one's meditation. Many other examples of guided meditation practices with inconsistent levels of quality can be found across Youtube and Google.[/p]\n\n[audio-player src=\"/audio/sam harris 9 minutes.ogg\" title=\"9 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Sam Harris\" /][audio-player src=\"/audio/sam harris 26 minutes.ogg\" title=\"26 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Sam Harris\" /][audio-player src=\"/audio/alan watts guided meditation.ogg\" title=\"15 minute guided meditation.\" artist=\"Alan Watts\" /][hr /][markdown text=\"### Subjective effects\" /]\n[p]The effects listed below are based upon the subjective effects index and personal experiences of PsychonautWiki contributors.

In this video I'm going to document and describe the psychedelic manifestation of the specific subjective effect known as an Internal Hallucination.[/p]\n\n[p]This will be in accordance with the terminology laid out within our comprehensive Subjective Effect Index and will be done without resorting to metaphors, analogies, or personal trip reports. To give you a better sense of the experience, to the best of our abilities we've also accompanied each description with relevant image and video replications.[/p]\n\n[p]So to varying degrees, complex internal hallucinations are an extremely common experience at sufficiently heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound, with substances such as [i]DMT, ayahuasca, psilocybin, mescaline, and 2C-E[/i] being just some of the more reliable substances for inducing this particlar effect.[/p]\n\n[p]As for the effect itself, An internal hallucination is defined as the perception of a visual hallucination that can include spontaneous moving or still images of scenes, beings, concepts, settings, landscapes, places, or anything one could imagine.[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, internal hallucinations primarily occur within an imagined inner environment, or on the back of the users eyelids, in a manner that is similar to that of dreams. This is in stark contrast to an external hallucination, which displays itself seamlessly into the persons surrounding environment as if it were physically present. I think this is an important distinction to make, because while fully formed external hallucinations can occassionally happen during a psychedelic experience, they are quite uncommon and usually more associated with deliriant hallucinogens, rather than traditional psychedelics. It's because of this that I am focusing the content on this video purely on internal rather than external hallucinations.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their appearance and general presentation, internal hallucinations are also often comprised from condensed psychedelic geometry. This is in a manner which can give them an incredibly complex incomprehensible and otherworldly aesthetic that is clearly demonstrated within the countless examples of visionary artwork shown here within this video[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]lower levels[/i], internal hallucinations begin with imagery on the back of a person's eyelids, which do not take up the entirety of one's visual field and are distinct from their background. The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic. They rarely hold their form for more than a few seconds before fading or shifting into another image. It is worth noting that this level of intensity occurs in a manner similar to that of hypnagogia, the state between sleep and wakefulness.[/p]\n\n[p]At [i]higher levels[/i], internal hallucinations become increasingly elaborate as they eventually become all-encompassing, fully-fledged 3D scenes that surround the person in a manner similar to that of [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams\"]dreams[/int-link]. This can create the feeling that one has \"broken-through\" into another reality. The things that occur within this perceived alternate reality can be anything, but fall under common archetypes such as contact with [int-link to=\"/effects/autonomous-entity\"]autonomous entities[/int-link], alongside a wide variety of [int-link to=\"/effects/settings-sceneries-and-landscapes\"]imagined landscapes[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/scenarios-and-plots\"]scenarios[/int-link].[/p]\n\n[p]This effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 5 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Enhancement of mental visualization\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, internal hallucinations can be defined as the distinct enhancement of mental visualisation that a person drifts into while daydreaming or using their imagination. It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field. This is where the content of these hallucinations usually becomes more spontaneous in nature and out of the person’s conscious control.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness and intensity increases in a fashion that renders the imagery seen within one’s visual field as fully defined and realistic in its appearance.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the vividness, scope, and intensity of the hallucinations become all-encompassing in a way that displays momentary flashes of scenes that surround the person in an immersive environment, similar to that of a vague dream. Although all-encompassing, they are often blurred or transparent in appearance and the person’s physical senses remain partially connected to the real world.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined immersion\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the internal hallucinations further increase to become all-encompassing in a manner that displays long-lasting scenes surrounding the person with an explorable and fully immersive environment similar to that of a dream. This occurs in a fashion that is fully detailed and highly vivid in its appearance. Typically, it also occurs alongside relevant [int-link to=\"/effects/auditory-hallucination\"]auditory[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/tactile-hallucination\"]tactile hallucinations[/int-link], as well as the sensation that a person has become completely disconnected from their physical body.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Outside of this levelling system, the subjective intensity of internal hallucinations are not only dependent on their detail or level of immersion, but also upon the speed and rate at which they successively occur between each other. For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content.

At their higher levels, they can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomable that it will often cause them to question how these hallucinations could possibly even originate from their own mind. It has always fascinated me that the brain is quite capable of instantaneously rendering scenes and images that are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that could ever occur within the real world.[/p]\n\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams/\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving something such as a sudden onset hallucination, there is often a feeling of amnesia that's identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\n\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \"reality checks\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner.[/p]\n\n[p]On a less important note, I think it's interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording. Alongside of this, the levelling system that I devised to measure the coherency of an autonomous entities communication methods can also be perfectly applied to that of dream characters without any modification at all. This was completely unintentional for both of these leveling systems and is, in my personal opinion, not a coincidence.[/p]\n\n[p]Although it could be argued that internal hallucinations are too characteristically different from that of dreams to possibly stem from the similar neurological processes, I think that these differences in their presentation are largely the result of the many other effects that are often simultaneously occurring during these experiences. The most notable one is geometry, which can cause the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide psychedelic hallucinations in particular with their distinctly \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially further synergize with the experience.[/p]\n\n[p]However, I am fully aware that this position is merely one of pure speculation and that I cannot prove this definitively. As the years go by, I am therefore hoping that further scientific research and study into this topic will be able to help elucidate the precise neurological causes behind this fascinating experience.[/p][/quote]\n","length":13152,"parsed":["\n",{"name":"captioned-image","properties":{"src":"/img/gallery/death-by-astonishment-by-salviadroid.jpg","border":"true","width":"300","artist":"SalviaDroid","title":"Death by Astonishment","caption":"This image serves as an example of visionary art that attempts to accurately portray and replicate the experience of psychedelic level 7 geometry combined with level 5 internal hallucinations.","align":"right","top":"true"},"children":null},"\n\n",{"name":"p","properties":{},"children":["Hey there!
