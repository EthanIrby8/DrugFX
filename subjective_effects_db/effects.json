It begins at lower intensities as a gradual distortion of an object's texture which causes them to subtly droop, wobble, and lose their structural integrity. This gradually increases until it becomes impossible to ignore as the lines, textures, and colour between solid objects melt into one another in an extremely fluid style.\n[h3]Flowing[/h3]Flowing can be described as a style of visual drifting that seems to occur almost exclusively on textures (particularly if they are highly detailed, complex, or rough in appearance). It results in the textures appearing to flow like a river in a seamless, looped animation.

This partially alters the appearance and form of shapes, objects, and sceneries within the external environment, causing them to subtly drift, bend, and morph.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Ubiquitous\" subHeader=\"Distinct Intensity\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, visual drifting becomes powerful enough to drastically alter and transform the shape of specific objects within a person’s external environment.

For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[p]Entities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Humans[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] [i]shadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"4\" /] [i]elves[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"6\" /] [i]animals[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"7\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"5\" /] [i]giant spheres, insectoids[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"6\" /] [i]beings of light, anthropomorphic beings[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"9\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"7\" /] [i]plants[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"10\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"8\" /] [i]conscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"11\" /] [i]demigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"12\" /] [i]angels[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"13\" /] [i]shamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more[/i].[/p]\n\n[p]The appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Vaguely defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them. However, this is still often accompanied by a distinct feeling of \"[int-link to=\"/effects/sensed-presence\"]sensed presence[/int-link]\".[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, autonomous entities become entirely visible within one’s visual field and distinguishable from their background, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"communication-styles\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\n\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"personality-types\"]Personality Types[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \n\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-characters\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-subconscious\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-self\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness. This entity will often take on a similar appearance to oneself, but could theoretically take on any other appearance too. During this experience, there is also a distinct feeling that one's own consciousness is somehow being mirrored and duplicated into the hallucinated autonomous entity that is being interacted with.[/p]\n","description_formatted":"[{\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"[captioned-image src=\\\"/img/gallery/Namaste_(Trifoliata_Mystica)_by_Luke_Brown.jpg\\\" width=\\\"300\\\" artist=\\\"Luke Brown\\\" title=\\\"Namaste\\n\\\" align=\\\"right\\\" top=\\\"true\\\" border=\\\"true\\\" /][p]An [b]autonomous entity[/b] is the experience of perceived contact with hallucinated beings that appear to be sentient and autonomous in their behaviour.[ref to=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"2\\\" /][ref to=\\\"3\\\" /][ref to=\\\"4\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"5\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"6\\\" /][ref to=\\\"7\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"8\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /][ref to=\\\"9\\\" no=\\\"1\\\" /] These entities can manifest within both [int-link to=\\\"external-hallucination\\\"]external[/int-link] and [int-link to=\\\"internal-hallucination\\\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link].[ref to=\\\"8\\\" no=\\\"2\\\" /][/p]\\n\\n[p]Autonomous entities will frequently act as the inhabitants of a perceived independent reality.[ref to=\\\"7\\\" no=\\\"2\\\" /] They most commonly appear alone but can also often be within small or large groups alongside of other entities.

While some entities do not seem to be aware of a person's presence, others are often precognizant of a person's appearance into their realm and usually choose to interact with them in various ways. For example, they will often display behaviours such as showing a person around the realm that they inhabit, presenting them with objects, holding spontaneous celebrations of their arrival, engaging them in conversation, merging into and out of the person's body or consciousness, and attempting to impart knowledge of various kinds.[/p]\n\n[toc /]\n\n[p]Entities can take any form, but certain archetypes are present and commonly include:[/p]\n\n[p][i]Humans[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] [i]shadow people, bodiless super intelligent humanoids, aliens[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"5\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"4\" /] [i]elves[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"6\" /] [i]animals[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"7\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"5\" /] [i]giant spheres, insectoids[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"8\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"6\" /] [i]beings of light, anthropomorphic beings[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"9\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"7\" /] [i]plants[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"10\" /][ref to=\"9\" no=\"8\" /] [i]conscious inanimate objects, fictional characters, cartoons, robotic machines, gods[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"11\" /] [i]demigods, goddesses, bio-mechanical intelligences, hooded figures, demons, indescribable monstrosities, spirits[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"12\" /] [i]angels[/i],[ref to=\"4\" no=\"13\" /] [i]shamans, ghosts, souls, ancestors, fantastical or mythological beasts, glitch creatures, and more[/i].[/p]\n\n[p]The appearance, personality, and behaviour of an autonomous entity often correlates with the psychological state of the person experiencing it. For example, a person with a positive mindset will more commonly experience loving, kind, and healing entities. In contrast, a person with a negative mindset may experience hateful, sinister, and mocking entities.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of their overall visibility and clarity, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 3 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Vaguely defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, autonomous entities generally consist of poorly defined outlines and silhoettes that are barely distinguishable from the background behind them. However, this is still often accompanied by a distinct feeling of \"[int-link to=\"/effects/sensed-presence\"]sensed presence[/int-link]\".[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, autonomous entities become entirely visible within one’s visual field and distinguishable from their background, but are not fully defined in their appearance. This means that, although clearly visible, they do not look completely detailed and are often blurry or semi-translucent. At this point, it also becomes more common to feel a sense of general intent and personality attributed to the entity.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined presence\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the autonomous entities become distinct enough in their detail and vividness to extend beyond transparent, colourless, or blurry manifestations. They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour also becomes far more lifelike.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]The experience of seeing autonomous entities is also often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link],[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link]. However, it can also occur under the influence of stimulant psychosis, with extreme sleep deprivation, or during dreams.[/p]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"communication-styles\"]Communication Styles[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities can communicate with a person via a combination of spoken word, “telepathy”, conceptual thoughts, choreographed movements, mathematics, and geometry-based visual linguistics that generally consist of morphing coloured structures of different textures that are innately understandable as representations of specific concepts. They will often convey insights regarding overcoming personal issues within a person’s life and will occasionally help clarify philosophical or spiritual ideas. However, more often than not, entities are very likely to speak in a cryptic or nonsensical manner that seems to have no clear meaning behind it.[/p]\n\n[p]It is important to note that autonomous entities can never convey novel information to the person experiencing them. For example, they cannot provide insights about the external world that a person did not already know on some level. Instead, they can only provide alternative perspectives and help build upon existing ideas. This is presumably because autonomous entities do not have access to any knowledge not already contained within one's conscious or subconscious memories.[/p]\n\n[p]When communicated with through spoken word, the level of coherency in which these entities can communicate with is highly variable but can be broken down into five distinct levels. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Silence\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, the effect can be described as a complete unresponsiveness from the entity and a lack of speech despite their presence within the hallucination.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses and noises that almost sound like words but do not contain any real content or meaning beyond a vague sense of emotional intent.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Fully defined incoherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#878786\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as audible linguistic conversational responses and noises that contain fully defined and understandable words, but often lack grammatical structure or an overall sense of general coherency.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Partially defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain fully defined and understandable words with a partially defined grammatical structure and general coherency. It conveys its point on a level that is frequently coherent, but may not always be fully understandable and will sometimes descend into broken grammar or even gibberish.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 5\" header=\"Fully defined coherent speech\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the highest level, the effect can be described as linguistic conversational responses that contain understandable words and fully defined grammatical sentence structures. It has an overall sense of general coherency, which conveys its point in a level of detail that is genuinely on par with that of a person’s own intellect.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr /]\n\n[h2 id=\"personality-types\"]Personality Types[/h2]\n[p]Autonomous entities will often embody at least one of a few approximate personality types. Although there is considerable overlap between them, these personality types can typically be identified primarily through their behaviour, their appearance, and an innate sense of their character that is often felt during the interaction.[/p] \n\n[p]The individual types are broken down and described within the four separate categories listed below:[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-characters\"]Representations of characters[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any hallucinatory character that the brain has either spontaneously generated during the trip or was already aware of at a prior time. These entities can include newly hallucinated characters of any sort, people that the person has met in real life, people that the person is aware of as existing in the real world, or characters from fictional media. These entities will usually adopt an appropriate personality and set of mannerisms to fit the chosen concept with an impressive degree of detail. An example of this might be meeting an insectoid mantis like creature that is playing the role of a shamanic teacher and acting accordingly. Another might include meeting the hallucination of a deceased loved one or a currently living family friend.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-ideas-and-concepts\"]Representations of ideas and concepts[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a seemingly sentient representation of any known concept or idea. These specific concepts could include personified representations of abstract ideas, events, and emotions. An example of this might be meeting a mocking jester that feels and acts as if it represents one's own insecurities. Another might include meeting a group of hooded figures that feel as if they represent the very concept of organized religion itself.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-subconscious\"]Representations of the subconscious[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as an entity that may take any visible form, but is also subjectively perceived to be an autonomous controller behind the continuous generation of the details of the person’s current hallucinations. They may also be felt to simultaneously control or manage one’s current perspective, personality, and internally stored model of reality. When interacted with, this category of entity can often possess abilities that allow them to directly alter and manipulate one’s current experiences. They commonly want to teach or guide the person and will operate under the assumption that they know what is best for them. However, although a relatively common experience, it still cannot be known whether this type of autonomous entity is genuinely a representation of the \"subconscious\" or is merely an approximation that behaves in a convincing manner.[/p]\n[h3 id=\"representations-of-the-self\"]Representations of the self[/h3]\n[p]This personality type can be described as a direct copy of one’s own personality. It can take any visible form, but when conversed with, it clearly adopts an identical vocabulary and set of mannerisms to one’s own consciousness.

They are now capable of a completely convincing and photorealistic appearance and their behaviour becomes far more lifelike. Additionally, they may become numerous enough to fully engulf the entirety of the person's environment.[/headered-textbox]\n\n[p]Alongside a specific levelling system, there are also environmental factors that directly alter both the likelihood of external hallucinations manifesting themselves and the level of detail they are rendered at.

It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy.

This results in a complete perceptual disconnection from one's sense of sight, which can be described as the experience of being completely blinded and unable to tell whether the eyes are open or closed due to a total lack of sensory input. During this state, the effect often leads one into the experience of finding themselves floating through a dark and mostly empty hallucinatory void.[/p]\n\n[subarticle id=\"holes-spaces-voids\"][h2]Holes, spaces, and voids[/h2][/subarticle]\n[p][i]Holes, spaces and voids[/i] are a sub-component of visual disconnection that manifest when it has become all-encompassing in its intensity. This experience is more commonly known as a \"K-hole\"[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /] and is generally discussed as something that is specifically associated with ketamine, despite being present within most traditional dissociatives. A K-hole can be described as the place a person finds themselves in once visual disconnection becomes powerful enough to leave the person incapable of receiving external sensory input, replacing their visual input with a space that subjectively feels as if it is outside of normal reality.[/p]\n[captioned-image src=\"/img/gallery/khole.jpg\" width=\"700\" border=\"true\" artist=\"Josie Kins\" title=\"The K-hole\" caption=\"This replication serves as a third person perspective replication of a K-hole experience.\" align=\"center\" /]\n[p]The visual appearance of this space, hole, or void can be described as a vast, mostly empty and darkened chamber that often feels and appears to be infinite in size. This space is usually dark black in its colour, but can occasionally display itself with large patches of slow-moving amorphous colour clouds or subtle geometric patterns across its horizon. At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.[/p]\n\n[p]Alongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations.

However, in my personal opinion, it is quite likely to be one of the most uniquely baffling and inexplicable effects when it comes to both undergoing it and considering the causes behind it. While I may not have a particularly in-depth academic knowledge of neurology and psychopharmacology, the vast majority of subjective effects that occur under the influence of hallucinogenic substances at least have some sort of vaguely plausible mechanism or cause that I can immediately speculate upon. In contrast, however, I have struggled for years to come up with a satisfying hypothesis on why Salvia Divinorum can cause human brains to quite reliably create states in which a person's awareness and felt bodily form suddenly becomes enveloped by rotating panels, conveyer belts, pulleys, gears, and all manner of other interlocking mechanical parts.[/p]\n\n[p]At face value, I would initially assume that machinescapes are simply a type of hallucination that occurs among people as a result of the cultural influence of living in a world in which we are all acutely aware of the existence of machinery. However, the fact that this experience is so consistently reported by people under the influence of a very specific compound leads me to believe that there is at least a little more to it than that. This is especially interesting to consider in the context of Salvia Divinorum's unique pharmacology, in which it functions as a potent k-opioid receptor agonist. While the k-opioid receptor system is not well understood, it is known that these receptors have the highest prevalence within the claustrum, a system that is the most densely connected structure in the brain and that's been shown to have widespread activity throughout numerous cortical components. These are associated with playing key roles in consciousness, higher cognitive functioning, and sustained attention. It is further theorised that the claustrum harmonises and coordinates activity in various parts of the cortex in a manner that leads to the seamlessly integrated nature of subjective conscious experience. All of this suggests to me that this unique hallucinogen is creating disruptions and changes to brain function that occur on a much deeper, widespread, and fundamental level than that of psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.[/p]\n\n[p]When taking this knowledge into consideration, I am led to suspect that machinescapes may occur under the influence of salvia due to the way this substance reliably disrupts consciousness on an all-encompassing level.

[ref to=\"9\" /] [/li]\n  [li] [b] Short-term memory: [/b] Faculties of the human mind that can hold a limited amount of information in a very accessible state temporarily. [ref to=\"9\" /] [ref to=\"10\" /] [ref to=\"11\" /] [/li]\n  [li] [b] Working memory: [/b] Information used to plan and carry out behavior. Not completely distinct from short-term memory, it's generally viewed as the combination of multiple components working together. Measures of working memory have been found to correlate with intellectual aptitudes (and especially fluid intelligence) better than measures of short-term memory and, in fact, possibly better than measures of any other particular psychological process. Both storage and processing have to be engaged concurrently to assess working memory capacity, which relates it to cognitive aptitude.

For example, [i] \"You know that smoodle pinkered and that I want to get him round and take care of him like you want before.\" [/i] As a result, it is often difficult to follow what the person is trying to say and the speakers are often unaware of their spoken mistakes. [/li]\n  \n  [li] [b] Global [/b]: People lose almost all language function, both comprehension and expression. They cannot speak or understand speech, nor can they read or write. This results from severe and extensive damage to the language areas of the brain. They may be unable to say even a few words or may repeat the same words or phrases over and over again. [/li]\n  \n  [li] [b] Anomic [/b] (or amnesiac):  the least severe form of aphasia; people have difficulty in using the correct names for particular objects, people, places, or events. [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n[p] Language suppression is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/analysis-suppression\"]analysis suppression[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-deceleration\"]thought deceleration[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of antipsychotic compounds, such as quetiapine[ref to=\"3\" /], haloperidol[ref to=\"4\" /], and risperidone[ref to=\"5\" /]. However, it can also occur in a less consistent form under the influence of extremely heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link][ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociatives[/int-link][ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"7\" /], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link][ref to=\"8\" /]. This is far more likely to occur when the person is inexperienced with that particular hallucinogen.

However, it also commonly occurs during moments of extreme stress and fear.[ref to=\"9\" /] [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[subarticle id=\"time-compression\"] [h2] Time compression [/h2] [/subarticle]\n\n[p] [i]Time compression[/i] is the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would.[ref to=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" /][ref to=\"10\" /] For example, during this state, a person may realize that an entire day or evening has passed them by in what feels like only a couple of hours. [/p]\n\n[p] This commonly occurs under the influence of stimulating compounds such as amphetamines and entactogens. With these particular substances, time compression seems to at least partially stem from the fact that during intense levels of [int-link to=\"/effects/stimulation\"]stimulation[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/focus-enhancement\"]focus-enhancement[/int-link], people typically become hyper-fixated on activities and tasks in a manner that causes them to both keep track of time less effectively and also become more likely to ignore any events which may be unfolding around them. [/p]\n\n[p] However, the same experience also commonly occurs in a different manner while under the influence of depressant compounds which induce [int-link to=\"/effects/amnesia\"]amnesia[/int-link], such as alcohol, GHB, and benzodiazepines. This is seemingly due to the way in which a person can forget events that occurred under the influence of the particular substance, thus giving the impression that they have suddenly jumped forward in time. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[subarticle id=\"time-reversal\"] [h2] Time Reversal [/h2] [/subarticle]\n\n[p] [i]Time reversal[/i] is the experience of perceiving the events that occurred around oneself within the previous several minutes or several hours, spontaneously playing backwards in a manner similar to that of a rewinding VHS tape. During this reversal, the person's cognition and train of thought typically continues to play forward in a coherent and linear manner while they watch the external environment around them and their body's physical actions play in reverse. It is speculated that the experience of time reversal may potentially occur through a combination of [int-link to=\"/categories/hallucinatory-states\"]visual hallucinations[/int-link] and errors in memory encoding. [/p]\n\n[p] Time reversal is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/thought-loops\"]thought loops[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/deja-vu\"]deja vu[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of extremely heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants/\"]deliriants[/int-link]. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[subarticle id=\"atemporality\"] [h2] Atemporality [/h2] [/subarticle]\n\n[p] [i]Atemporality[/i] is the experience of feeling as if one's conscious awareness is now outside of, disconnected from, and uninfluenced by the normal passage of linear time. During this state, there is often a sense that the flow of time has ceased to function and has also become inherently meaningless. [/p]\n\n[p] While experiencing atemporality, one’s ability to conceptualize ordinary time may be compromised in several ways. For example, the concept of ‘one hour’ may no longer make any sense. As a different example, the concepts of ‘one second’ and ‘one year’ may both seem like a single well-defined unit. The paradoxical sensation of ‘existing’ outside of time is also often connected to reports of being unable to adequately describe this effect using ordinary language. [/p]\n\n[p] Atemporality is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/perception-of-eternalism\"]perception of eternalism[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/visual\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, psilocybin, and mescaline. [/p]\n\n[p] An experience of transcending time is also one among many criteria assessed by the MEQ-30, which is a standardized questionnaire used in clinical research observing how psychedelic-induced mystical experiences can occasion positive long-term changes in patients’ mental health.[ref to=\"11\" /] [/p]"},"long_summary":{"_id":{"$oid":"606f6708bc69a65a808e49b6"},"length":3099,"parsed":"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\" \",{\"name\":\"b\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"Time distortion\"]},\" is an effect that makes the passage of time feel wildly distorted and difficult to keep track of.

Delusions are not usually amenable to logic and are often immediately recognizable as false and absurd to others. [ref to=\"1\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"3\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants/\"]deliriants[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link]. However, they can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of cannabinoids, stimulant psychosis, and sleep deprivation. [/p]\n\n[p] This article focuses primarily on the types of delusion that are commonly induced with hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances. It therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all delusions listed within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that are known to occur to people who suffer from chronic psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [/p]\n\n[h3] Substance-induced vs Disease-based Delusions [/h3]\n\n[p] When associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned. [/p]\n\n[h3] Overvalued Beliefs [/h3] \n\n[p] It is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs which are overvalued though not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper. [/p]\n\n[h3] Hypercertainty [/h3] \n\n[p] A common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs.

[/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Sobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of dobriety[/i] typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control loss[/int-link], and an inability to fully communicate with others. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one's own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one's ego, or a genuine inability to identify one's own intoxication. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Permanent Unsobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of permanent unsobriety[/i] is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state.

[/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds.

[/p]\\n\\n[h3] Substance-induced vs Disease-based Delusions [/h3]\\n\\n[p] When associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Overvalued Beliefs [/h3] \\n\\n[p] It is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs which are overvalued though not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Hypercertainty [/h3] \\n\\n[p] A common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs. The intensity of this conviction roughly corresponds to the intensity of the substance’s effect.

[/p]\n\n[p] A list of common examples of this type of delusion are described and documented below: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n [li] Believing that people in a passing car are talking about you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that people on television or in other forms of media are talking about or directly to you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that headlines and news articles are written specifically for or about you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that events (even world events) have been deliberately planned for you, or have special personal significance for you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the lyrics of a song are specifically about or for you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that electronic devices are sending you secret and significant messages that only you are capable of understanding. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that objects, situations, and events are being deliberately organized to convey a special or particular meaning to you. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that the slightest  bodily movement of another person has a significant and deliberate meaning. [/li]\n\n [li] Believing that posts on social media have hidden meanings pertaining to you.  [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n\n[h3] Delusions of death \u0026 dying [/h3]\n\n[p] [i]Delusions of Death \u0026 Dying[/i] are distressing, falsely-held beliefs that one is about to die, is currently dying, no longer exists, or has already died. This delusion may be a result of a diminished sense of self or identity that usually occurs during states of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link]. [/p]\n\n[p] These delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy doses of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] and to a lesser extent [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link].  \n[markdown text=\"#### Delusions of guilt\" /][i]Delusions of Guilt[/i] are caused by unfounded and intense feelings of remorse or guilt that lead the person to conclude that one must have committed some sort of deeply unethical act. The supposed unethical act can range from something relatively mild, such as the belief that the person has cheated on their partner; it can also be something much more serious, such as the belief that they have murdered their friends and family. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of guilt are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[p] [markdown text=\"#### Delusions of Reified Fiction\" /][i]Delusions of reified fiction[/i] are the unfounded belief that something fictional, such as the plot of a TV show, film, video game, or book, is an actual real-life event. This delusion may manifest as the perception that the fictional events within media that is currently being consumed are genuinely occurring in one's immediate vicinity, or simply that the events in the media are real and currently occurring somewhere in the world. This delusion seems to be a result of high-level [int-link to=\"/effects/immersion-enhancement\"]immersion enhancement[/int-link] combined with [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] creating a state of mind in which somebody is highly engrossed in media while no longer having a functional long-term memory that can recall the difference between reality and fiction. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of reified fiction are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[p] [h3] Delusional Derealization [/h3] [i]Delusional derealization[/i] is the unfounded belief that the person is currently inside of a video game, dream, or movie and therefore their current actions will not have any real-life consequences. In extreme situations and depending on the person, this delusion can sometimes result in committing crimes or violent acts. It seems to be a result of intense [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/derealization\"]derealization[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/disinhibition\"]disinhibition[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] combining to create an altered state of mind in which somebody mistakes reality for a fictional hallucination. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusional derealization is most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogens and occasionally during stimulant psychosis. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Sobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of dobriety[/i] typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control loss[/int-link], and an inability to fully communicate with others. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one's own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one's ego, or a genuine inability to identify one's own intoxication. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusions of Permanent Unsobriety [/h3] \n\n[p] A [i]delusion of permanent unsobriety[/i] is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\n\n[p] Delusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[h3] Shared delusions [/h3] \n\n[p] Shared delusions are when a delusional belief is experienced in a group setting and it begins to spread between individuals who are similarly intoxicated.[ref to=\"4\" no=\"1\" /] For example, if one person makes a verbal statement regarding a delusional belief that they are currently holding while in the presence of other similarly intoxicated people, they may also begin to hold the same delusion. This can result in shared hallucinations and a general reinforcement of the level of conviction in which they are each holding the delusional belief. [/p]\n\n[p] Shared delusions are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds. [/p]\n\n[h3] Delusional parasitosis [/h3] \n\n[p] [i]Delusional parasitosis[/i], also known as [i]Ekbom's syndrome[/i],[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] is a form of delusion in which victims acquire a strongly held belief that they are infested with parasites, bugs, and insects, whereas in reality, no such parasites are present.[ref to=\"15\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Sufferers may injure themselves in attempts to rid themselves of the \"parasites.\" Some are able to induce the condition in others through suggestion, in which case the term \"folie à deux\" may be applicable.[ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"16\" no=\"1\" /] During this state, nearly any marking upon the skin, small object or particle found on the person or their clothing can be interpreted as evidence for the parasitic infestation. If this delusion is ongoing, sufferers may compulsively gather such \"evidence\" and then present it to medical professionals when seeking help.[ref to=\"17\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] In the context of psychoactive substances, it is particularly common during stimulant psychosis after chronic usage of cocaine.[ref to=\"18\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]"},"long_summary":{"_id":{"$oid":"606fd6590434ff659f8d1290"},"length":1669,"parsed":"[{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\" A \",{\"name\":\"b\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\"delusion\"]},\" is a spontaneously occurring false belief held with strong conviction regardless of evidence to the contrary, rational argument, or how much the belief seemingly contradicts the individual's prior understanding of the world. \"]},\"\\n\\n\",{\"name\":\"p\",\"properties\":{},\"children\":[\" Within the context of hallucinogen usage, delusions can usually be broken out of when overwhelming evidence is provided to the contrary or when the person has sobered up enough to logically analyse the situation.

[/p]\n\n[p] Major depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"2\" /] It results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"1\" /] Stressful life events are significantly associated with depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Depression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning.

However, differentiating normal sadness/grief from a depressive episode requires a careful and meticulous examination. For example: the death of a loved one may cause great suffering, but it does not typically produce a [i]medically defined[/i] depressive episode.[ref to=\"1\" no=\"2\" /] [/p] \n\n[toc/]\n\n[p] Within the context of psychoactive substance usage, depressivity is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/anxiety\"]anxiety[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/irritability\"]irritability[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-dysphoria\"]dysphoria[/int-link]. It is most commonly induced through prolonged chronic stimulant or depressant use, during the withdrawal symptoms of almost any substance, or during the comedown/crash of a stimulant. It is associated specifically with higher alcohol consumption.[ref to=\"4\" no=\"1\" /]However, it is worth noting that substance-induced depressivity is often much shorter lasting than clinical depression, usually subsiding once the effects or withdrawal symptoms of a drug have ended. [/p] \n\n[p] If you suspect that you are experiencing symptoms of depression, it is highly recommended to seek out therapeutic medical attention and/or a support group. Additionally, you may want to read our [int-link to=\"/effects/depression-reduction\"]depression reduction[/int-link] effect and [int-link to=\"/effects/psychedelic-therapy\"]Psychedelic Therapy[/int-link] review. [/p] \n\n[p] It is worth noting that depression as an effect has an unfortunately non-specific definition. It is due to this that there are a number of other relevant terms which should be taken into account when trying to understand this state of mind. These are listed and described below:\n\n[hr/]\n[h2 id=\"depressive-conditions\"]Known Depressive Conditions[/h2]\n\n[h3 id=\"depressivity\"]Depressivity[/h3]\nDepressivity is medically recognized as feelings of being intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless. Some patients describe an [int-link to=\"/effects/emotion-suppression\"]absence of feelings[/int-link] and/or [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-dysphoria\"]dysphoria[/int-link]; difficulty recovering from such moods; pessimism about the future; pervasive shame and/or guilt; feelings of inferior self-worth; and thoughts of suicide and suicidal behavior.[ref to=\"2\" no=\"1\" /]Depressive symptoms may include [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-fatigue\"]fatigue[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/focus-suppression\"]lack of ability to concentrate[/int-link], or significant changes in weight or sleep.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"major-depressive-disorder\"] Major Depressive Disorder [/h3] \n\n[p]Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is medically recognized as discrete episodes of depressivity lasting at least two weeks (although most episodes last considerably longer).[ref to=\"1\" no=\"3\" /]This is the traditional characterization for the term medical term depression. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"dysthymia\"] Dysthymia [/h3] \n\n[p] Dysthymia is medically recognized as a chronic major depressive disorder and is typically diagnosed after two years of continued mood disturbance.[ref to=\"1\" no=\"4\" /][ref to=\"2\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"acute-depressivity\"] Acute depressivity [/h3]\n\n[p] Acute depressivity (colloquially referred to as \"feeling depressed\"), when indicated by either self-report or observation made by others, encompasses the following symptoms: [/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Feeling intensely sad, miserable, and/or hopeless along with pessimism about the future. [/li]\n[li] Anhedonia: a markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities. [/li]\n[li] Unintentional weight losses and gains. [/li]\n[li] Inability to sleep or sleeping too much. [/li]\n[li] Restlessness or feeling slowed down. [/li]\n[li] Intense fatigue or loss of energy. [/li]\n[li] Feelings worthless or excessive/inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) [/li]\n[li] Diminished ability to think/concentrate, or indecisiveness. [/li]\n[li] Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying). [/li]\n[li] Recurrent suicidal ideation: without a specific plan, having a plan, or a suicide attempt. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] For a diagnosis of major depressive disorder to be accurate, the symptoms must cause readily observable distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning for an extended period of time. The episode must not be better explained by a different mood disorder. The symptoms also cannot be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n[h2 id=\"analysis\"]Analysis[/h2]\n\n[p] Unless otherwise noted, the studies referenced here will refer to Depression as it is traditionally defined in medical and scientific literature AKA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). [/p]\n\n[p] Major depression affects 5-20% of the population at some point in their life.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"2\" /] It results from the combination of genetics and environments with a heritability of greater than 30%. Common environmental influences (parenting style, socioeconomic status, or local environmental qualities) are quite small; however this does not mean these influences are irrelevant. What seems to matter is how a specific individual interacts with their environment across developmental stages.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"1\" /] Stressful life events are significantly associated with depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Depression is a life-threatening disorder. Both depression and subclinical depression increase all-cause mortality similarly; [ref to=\"7\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"8\" no=\"1\" /]however subclinical depression does not have an exact definition yet (making it harder to study). The impact depression has on quality of life is comparable or greater than other chronic medical illnesses.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"3\" /] [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"cognitive-impairment\"] Cognitive Impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Cognitive impairment is a core feature of depression that remains after remission and cannot be considered a result of low mood.[ref to=\"9\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"10\" no=\"1\" /]Although there is some evidence associating depressivity and functionality, depression severity accounts for -at most- 10% of the variability in cognitive dysfunction. Both age of onset and depression severity also modify this effect’s magnitude and what cognitive deficits arise.[ref to=\"11\" no=\"1\" /]As a generality (not developed in parallel), more severe depression correlates with significant decreases in cognitive performance. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"11\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Moderate decrease: Executive function, Attention, Episodic memory (not semantic or visuo-spatial) [/li]\n  [li] Mild decrease: Processing speed [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p]These cognitive deficits are significantly associated with poor psychosocial functioning (psychological factors combined with the surrounding social environment). [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"psychosocial-impairment\"] Psychosocial impairment [/h3]\n\n[p] Psychosocial impairment is also a core feature of depression that remains after remission. Psychosocial stressors are associated with the onset, severity, and progression of MDD.[ref to=\"12\" no=\"1\" /]More severe depression can be considered a disability, or disorder, of psychosocial function.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"4\" /]Even brief psychosocial interventions in the form of collaborative care (e.g. a telephone call reminding to take medication) may be comparably effective to more intensive forms of face-to-face psychotherapy.[ref to=\"13\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Improving cognitive deficits may also improve psychosocial functioning. Although impaired attention and executive functions remain in patients whose depressive symptoms alleviate, memory functions may improve to only a small deficit. [ref to=\"9\" no=\"3\" /] Improvements in mood are most closely related to improvements in verbal memory, verbal fluency, and psychomotor speed. [/p]\n\n[h3 id=\"immune-system\"] Immune System [/h3] \n\n[p] Depression is accompanied by immune system dysregulation and activation of the body’s inflammatory response system.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"5\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"2\" /][ref to=\"14\" no=\"1\" /] Specific biomarkers have small but significantly higher concentrations associated with the incidence and severity of depression. [/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [ref to=\"3\" no=\"6\" /] [/li]\n  [li] Chemokines for Monocyte Chemotactic Protein (MCP)-1/CCL2 [ref to=\"14\" no=\"2\" /] [/li]\n  [li] C Reactive protein[ref to=\"7\" no=\"3\" /] and its interleukin precursors: [/li]\n  [li] Interleukin-6 (IL-6), associated with reduced hippocampal grey matter volume and is increased with higher BMI via Leptin[ref to=\"3\" no=\"7\" /] [ref to=\"7\" no=\"4\" /] [/li]\n  [li] IL-1ra,[ref to=\"7\" no=\"5\" /] but not IL1-β[ref to=\"3\" no=\"8\" /] | IL1 is difficult to detect in plasma since it works primarily at the local site of inflammation and new forms are still being discovered. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[p] It is difficult to say how biological sex interacts due to increasing the number of females in a sample causing the relationship between depression and inflammation to become nonsignificant.[ref to=\"7\" no=\"6\" /]Estrogen interacts with CRP and IL6, thus fluctuations in menstrual cycles and hormonal contraceptives may affect these results. Yet, overall the fundamental genetic architecture appears the same across samples and genders.[ref to=\"5\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] These proinflammatory small protein messengers, called cytokines, increase indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression in both central and peripheral immune-competent cells. IDO increases the synthesis of kynurenine from dietary tryptophan, so this may cause a decrease in tryptophan availability. Tryptophan is required to synthesize serotonin and melatonin.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"9\" /]Additionally, there is no evidence the serotonin transporter genotype alone or in interaction with stressful life events is associated with an elevated risk of depression.[ref to=\"6\" no=\"2\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Kynurenine also produces endogenous NMDA agonist metabolites that could disrupt neurotransmission along glutaminergic pathways and lead to excitotoxicity in the form of hippocampal neuron damage/death.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"10\" /] [/p]\n\n[p] Within the central nervous system, proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the body’s stress response system and within the regulation of neurogenesis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"11\" /]\n[markdown text=\"#### HPA AXIS\" /]Stress response is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.[ref to=\"3\" no=\"12\" /]The HPA axis allows organisms to adapt to physical and psychosocial changes in their environments.

[/p]\n\n[p] Adaptation can be separated into three phases, each with different physiological processes. Mineralocorticoid receptors regulate cortisol during periods of low HPA activity. Glucocorticoid receptors regulate response to stress and cortisol during high HPA activity. [/p]\n\n[ol]\n  [li] Baseline: unstimulated, non-stressed. [/li]\n  [li] Stress reactivity: cortisol increases from baseline. [/li]\n  [li] Stress recovery: following offset of the stressor, cortisol levels return to baseline. [/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[p] Major Depression Disorder patients have impaired stress reactivity and recovery, with more severe depression being more impairing.

It was originally created by the late theoretical physicist John Archibald Wheeler in his 1983 paper Law Without Law. The eye represents the self and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that it is a singular and unified system.\" border=\"true\" align=\"right\" /]\n\n[p][b]Unity and interconnectedness[/b] can be described as an experience where one's sense of self becomes temporarily changed to feel as if it is constituted by a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]It is worth noting that many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.” However, it is important to understand that these conclusions and feelings should not necessarily be accepted at face value as inherently true.[/p]\n\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\n\n[p]There are a total of four distinct levels of identity a person can experience during this state. These various altered states of unity have been arranged into a leveling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts that one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described below. [/p]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Unity between specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#aaaaaa\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At the lowest level, this effect can be described as a perceived sense of unity between two or more systems within the external environment, which are usually perceived as separate from each other in everyday life. This is the least complex level of unity, as it is the only level of interconnectedness where the subjective experience of unity does not involve a state of interconnectedness between the self and the external.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\n  [li] A sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\" labelBackground=\"#999997\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity (in addition to the body and/or brain) is attributed to specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\n\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts that are currently the subject of a person's attention within the perceivable external environment. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\n\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.[/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 3\" header=\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\" labelBackground=\"#777776\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment due to a loss of perceived boundaries between the previously separate systems.[/p]\n\n[p]The effect creates a sensation that a person has become \"one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to the internal narrative of the ego as well as the body itself and everything physically percepted around it. It creates the compelling perspective that one is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body that one's consciousness is currently residing in.[/p]\n\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level unity experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external system in one's environment. For example, when one is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though one is a central agent acting on the separate world around them. However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 4\" header=\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\" labelBackground=\"#555554\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n\n[p]At the highest level, this effect can be described as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as \"becoming one with the universe\".[/p]\n\n[p]When experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time that this particular body and conscious perception currently resides within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”[/p]\n\n[p]Although they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, many commonly reported conclusions share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature, which are often interpreted as profound realizations. These are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n\n[ul]\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating and self-sustaining, then the universe and its contents could also be viewed as \"god\". [/li]\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements. [/li]\n[/ul]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[h3]Further reading[/h3]\n\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:[/p]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics)\"] Oneness [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and that it works together as a unified system of behaviour. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism\"]Dialectical monism [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one, but can usually only be experienced in terms of division. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling\"] The oceanic feeling [/ext-link] is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form. [/li]\n\n[li] [ext-link to=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism\"] Nondualism[/ext-link] is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self.

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \\\"external\\\" systems.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It is worth noting that many people who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, the destruction of which is often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.” However, it is important to understand that these conclusions and feelings should not necessarily be accepted at face value as inherently true.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Feelings of unity and interconnectedness most commonly occur under the influence of [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\\\"]psychedelic[/int-link] and [int-link to=\\\"/summaries/dissociatives\\\"]dissociative[/int-link] compounds, such as LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and ketamine. However, they can also occur during well-practiced meditation, deep states of contemplation, and intense focus.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are a total of four distinct levels of identity a person can experience during this state. These various altered states of unity have been arranged into a leveling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts that one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described below. [/p]\\n\\n[hr/]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 1\\\" header=\\\"Unity between specific external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#aaaaaa\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At the lowest level, this effect can be described as a perceived sense of unity between two or more systems within the external environment, which are usually perceived as separate from each other in everyday life. This is the least complex level of unity, as it is the only level of interconnectedness where the subjective experience of unity does not involve a state of interconnectedness between the self and the external.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between specific living things, such as animals or plants and their surrounding ecosystems. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between other human beings and the objects they are currently interacting with. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between any number of currently perceivable inanimate objects. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between humanity and nature. [/li]\\n  [li] A sense of unity between literally any combination of perceivable external systems and concepts. [/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 2\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and specific external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#999997\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity (in addition to the body and/or brain) is attributed to specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.[/p]\\n\\n[p]The experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts that are currently the subject of a person's attention within the perceivable external environment. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \\\"connected to\\\", \\\"one with\\\", \\\"the same as\\\", or \\\"unified\\\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.[/p]\\n\\n[p]There are an endless number of ways in which this level can manifest itself, but common examples of the experience often include:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li] Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object that one is interacting with. [/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people. This is particularly common if they are engaging in sexual or romantic activities.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people. This is particularly common at raves and music festivals.[/li]\\n[li]Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.[/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 3\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and all perceivable external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#777776\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n[p]At this level, unity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment due to a loss of perceived boundaries between the previously separate systems.[/p]\\n\\n[p]The effect creates a sensation that a person has become \\\"one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to the internal narrative of the ego as well as the body itself and everything physically percepted around it. It creates the compelling perspective that one is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body that one's consciousness is currently residing in.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It is at this point that a key component of the high-level unity experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external system in one's environment. For example, when one is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though one is a central agent acting on the separate world around them. However, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.[/p] [/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\\\"Level 4\\\" header=\\\"Unity between the self and all known external systems\\\" labelBackground=\\\"#555554\\\" headerBackground=\\\"#F0F0F0\\\"]\\n\\n[p]At the highest level, this effect can be described as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as \\\"becoming one with the universe\\\".[/p]\\n\\n[p]When experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that one is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through a specific point in space and time that this particular body and conscious perception currently resides within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”[/p]\\n\\n[p]Although they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, many commonly reported conclusions share common themes of a religious and metaphysical nature, which are often interpreted as profound realizations. These are described and listed below:[/p]\\n\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li] The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of oneself, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\\n[li] The subjective perspective that one's preconceived notions of \\\"god\\\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating and self-sustaining, then the universe and its contents could also be viewed as \\\"god\\\". [/li]\\n[li] The subjective perspective that one, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all humanity's sufferings and flaws, but also includes its acts of love and achievements. [/li]\\n[/ul]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[h3]Further reading[/h3]\\n\\n[p]Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources. A number of these have been collected and listed as a set of documented examples below:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneness_(metaphysics)\\\"] Oneness [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that there is only one thing which all things are not separate from and that it works together as a unified system of behaviour. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism\\\"]Dialectical monism [/ext-link] is a philosophical position arguing that the appearance of duality arises from the mind's need to impose divisions and boundaries upon an essentially unified whole. Thus, for the dialectical monist, reality is ultimately one, but can usually only be experienced in terms of division. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_feeling\\\"] The oceanic feeling [/ext-link] is a state within psychology which is described as a sensation of an indissoluble bond of being connected with the external world in its integral form. [/li]\\n\\n[li] [ext-link to=\\\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondualism\\\"] Nondualism[/ext-link] is a philosophy found within many religions which states that there is no difference between the concept of the external environment and the self.

I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  [/p]\n\n[p]However, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life.

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, during this state their sense of identity can change to include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. Alternatively, a person could feel as if their sense of self embodies nothing at all, which is an experience commonly referred to as ##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}.\n\nThere are a total of 5 distinct levels of identity which a person can experience. These various altered states of identity have been arranged into a levelling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts one's identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described and documented below:\n##md{### 1. Total absence of attributed identity (depersonalization)}The lowest level of identity can be described as the sensation that there is a complete absence of having any sense of self at all. This is referred to in psychiatry as \"##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}\". It can be described as an anomaly of self-awareness that consists of a feeling of watching oneself act as one normally would, while also feeling is if they have no control over the situation. During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviours as belonging to a person or identity. It is also often claimed by people who have depersonalization that reality seems unreal, distant or hazy. \n\nDepersonalization can sometimes be distressing to the user, who may become disoriented by the loss of a sense that their self is the origin of their thoughts and actions. However, it does not have to be an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one's emotions or thought patterns.\n\nIt is perfectly normal for many people to slip into this state temporarily, often without even realizing it. For example, many people often note that they enter a detached state of autopilot during stressful situations or when performing monotonous routine tasks such as driving.\n\nWithin the context of identity-altering effects, depersonalization can be considered as being at the opposite end of the identity spectrum relative to states of ##int-link|to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"{unity and interconnectedness}. This is because, during depersonalization, a person senses and attributes their identity to nothing, giving a sense of having no self. However, during a state of unity and interconnectedness, one senses and attributes their identity to everything, giving a sense that the entirety of existence is their self.\n\nDepersonalization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and a very similar psychological disorder known as derealization. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"{dissociative} compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and ##int-link|to=\"/substances/dxm/\"{DXM}. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent during the withdrawal symptoms of stimulants and depressants.\n##md{### 2. Self-contained separate identity}The second level of identity can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to their brain and/or body. This is often said to feel as if one is a consciousness, the guiding force located within a body which is immersed in and interacting with a distinctly separate external environment. It is usually accompanied with a sense of free will or agency over all the thoughts and actions the person makes, which results in them feeling as if their decision-making processes are arising from an internal source which is not necessarily determined by cause and effect in the same manner as external systems.\n\nA self-contained separate identity is by far the most common form of identity. Mainstream Western cultural notions consider this conception of identity to be the self-evident and logical way to perceive the world as well as the only form of identity which isn't intrinsically delusional. Despite being culturally normative, this belief has received considerable debate and criticism within modern neuroscience and philosophy.\n\nAlthough drastically altered in comparison to that of sobriety, it is also worth noting that hallucinatory states such as ego replacement and 2nd person ##int-link|to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"{perspective hallucinations} typically still fall under the classification of this level. In both cases, a person still feels as if they are a separate agent facing the external world, but have the perception of being a different identity than their sober self.\n##md{### 3. Identifying with specific \"external\" systems}The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one's own being.\n\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.\n\nThere are an endless number of ways in which this level manifests itself, but common examples of the experience often include:\n\n##md{- Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object one is interacting with.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people, particularly common if engaging in sexual or romantic activities.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one's own physical body.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people, particularly common at raves and music festivals.\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.}\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{### 4. Identifying with all perceivable \"external\" systems}The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.\n\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.\n\nIt is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person's sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.\n\nHowever, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction. Instead, the process suddenly feels as if it has become completely decentralized and holistic, as the environment begins to autonomously and harmoniously respond to itself in a predetermined manner to perform the interaction carried out by the individual.\n\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"{psychedelics}.\n##md{### 5. Identifying with all known \"external\" systems}##cap-img|src=\"/img/gallery/Artistic_depiction_of_unity.png\"|top=\"true\"|border=\"true\"|width=\"250\"|artist=\"John Archibald Wheeler\"|title=\"Self Excited Circuit\"|caption=\"This symbol depicts the universe as a self-excited circuit. The eye represents an observer and the line directly opposite represents that which it is perceiving within the external environment. The two sections are connected into each other via arrows to demonstrate that they are a singular and unified system.\"|align=\"right\"The fifth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one's identity is simultaneously attributed to the entirety of the immediately perceivable external environment and all known concepts that exist outside of it. These known concepts typically include all of humanity, nature, and the universe as it presently stands in its complete entirety. This feeling is commonly interpreted by people as becoming one with the universe.\n\nWhen experienced, the effect creates the sudden perspective that the person is not a separate agent approaching an external reality, but is instead the entire universe as a whole experiencing itself, exploring itself, and performing actions upon itself through the specific point in space and time which this particular body and conscious perception happens to currently reside within. People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\n\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\n\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\n- The subjective perspective that the person's preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one's personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity's sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\n##md{#### Further reading}Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources.

This most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.","analysis_raw":"The concept of identity itself can be defined as a fundamental and near-universal component of human perception that provides the experience of feeling like a self, a separate system intrinsically differentiated from the external world. This feeling is commonly referred to as one's sense of identity, ego, or selfhood. In general conversation, it is referred to using pronouns such as \"I\", \"me\", \"mine\", and \"myself\" as a tool for contrasting one's self from other people and any other system which is not felt to be them.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that rather than being a static, unmoving, or objective concept that it is often assumed to be, a person's identity can actually be experienced in many ways. There is no component of the human brain, body, or consciousness which can be singled out as the location of a person's individual selfhood. The self is thus speculated to be a learned and constructed concept that arises through a combination of experience, the structure of language, and social interactions with other people. This notion is in stark contrast to the common Western cultural conception that human beings each contain a tangible identity that is a real and separate system from that which resides around it.\n\nWithin traditional religions, the intrinsic nature of human identity differs depending on the specific doctrine. For example, Abrahamic religions such as Christianity and Islam use an inherently dualist approach which claims that the self is a soul which resides within the body and is intrinsically separate from its external environment. In contrast, Eastern religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism take an approach known as monism, or nondualism which generally speaking assumes that the separate self is illusory and that there is no difference between one's identity or soul and the \"external\" universe which it resides in.","analysis_formatted":"[{\"type\":\"string\",\"value\":\"The concept of identity itself can be defined as a fundamental and near-universal component of human perception that provides the experience of feeling like a self, a separate system intrinsically differentiated from the external world.

Ketamine has reported cases of severe bladder and liver injury.

However, in recent short-term clinical trials esketamine still more-than-doubled the amount of adverse bladder events when compared to placebo (6-10% vs 1-4%).  Although 2/3 of esketamine incidents resolved themselves either without intervention or through a lowering of dosage, any physiological damage is acute and immediate: in typical dose regimens steady-state concentrations are not reached.

In severe cases, however, body temperature can increase to greater than 41.1 C (106.0 F). This can result in complications including seizures, extensive muscle breakdown, and even death.[/p]\n\n[p]Serotonin syndrome is most commonly induced when recklessly combining multiple serotonergic substances, especially those which function as serotonin releasers or reuptake inhibitors. To varying degrees, common examples of these  include various combinations of the following substances:[/p]\n\n[h3] Recreational Substances [/h3]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] [b] Stimulants [/b] - Amphetamines, Cocaine, MDMA, MDA, Methylone [/li]\n[li] [b] Hallucinogens [/b]- LSD, 2C-x, Dox, 5-MeO-MipT, AMT, DXM [/li]\n[li] [b] Miscellaneous [/b]- Tramadol, Syrian Rue [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n[h3] Medications [/h3]\n\n[ul]\n\n[li] [b] SSRIs [/b] - Citalopram, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, setraline [/li]\n[li] [b] SNRIs [/b] - Duloxetine, venlafaxine [/li]\n[li] [b] TCAs [/b] - Amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepine, imipramine, nortriptyline [/li]\n[li] [b] MAOIs [/b] - Isocarboxacid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, mirtazipine [/li]\n[li] [b] Dopamine Agonists [/b] - Amantadine, bromocriptine, levodopa [/li]\n[li] [b] Triptans [/b] - Sumatriptain, zolmitriptan, frovatriptan, rizatriptan, almotriptan, naratriptan, eletriptan [/li]\n[li] [b] Herbal/Nutritional Supplements [/b] - St. John's Wort, Panax ginseng, tryptophan, 5-HTP [/li]\n[li] [b] Miscellaneous [/b] - Bupropion, trazodone [/li]\n\n[/ul]\n\n[p] However, this list is far from comprehensive. If you are considering combining multiple substances, it is incredibly important to do your own research.

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.[/p]\n\n[p]For more information on this experience, please see our comprehensive article on states of [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]Unity and Interconnectedness[/int-link].[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"transformative-aspects\"]Transformative aspects[/h2]\n\n[p]Ego death is well known for the transformative and significant impacts it can often have on a person's perception of both themselves and the world around them. These responses and alterations can occur both during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards. [/p]\n\n[p]A few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:[/p]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"rejuvenation\" header=\"Rejuvenation\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]Rejuvenation[/int-link][/i] is a feeling of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which is usually felt once the experience of ego death is over and the person has also fully recovered from the trip as a whole. The symptoms of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, increased emotional stability, increased calmness, mindfulness, increased motivation, personal bias suppression, increased focus, and decreased depression. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn\" anew. Within the context of ego death, rejuvenation often feels as if it has occurred in a manner which is akin to that of rebooting a computer.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"personal-bias-suppression\" header=\"Personal Bias Suppression\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i][int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]Personal bias suppression[/int-link][/i] is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations a person knowingly or unknowingly filters and interprets their perception of the world through. Within the context of ego death, personal bias suppression feels as if it occurs due to some sort of baseline resetting of the contexts which the ego increasingly attributes to concepts over time. This often results in the feeling of processing concepts from a neutral perspective completely untainted by past memories, prior experiences, contexts, and biases.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"overcoming-fear-of-death\" header=\"Overcoming fear of death\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\n[p][i]Overcoming the fear of death[/i] is very a common conclusion and feeling that is associated with ego death, with those who have undergone ego death often reporting that they not only \"experienced what it is like to die\", but also became both accustomed to and substantially less afraid of the prospect. This is seemingly because the experience of letting go during ego death and willfully surrendering one's own sense of self is often likened to that of the preconceived notions that many people hold about what it is like to die.[/p]\n[/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"fear-of-losing-control\" header=\"Fear of losing control\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]A [i]fear of losing control[/i] is a very common occurrence when a person that undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before. [/p]\n\n[p]In order to overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death. Upon successfully doing this, the person will often experience a radical and positive change in their emotional state.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"viewing-the-self-as-an-illusory-construct\" header=\"Viewing the self as an illusory construct\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Viewing the self as an illusory construct[/i] is commonly caused by the way in which undergoing the ego-death experience often provokes radical insight into the nature of the self. These insights may take a number of forms. For example, in the case of [i]absent[/i] and [i]objectified self-hood[/i], one may conclude that the ego is not an essential component of who they are. Instead, it may come to be known as a construct of the mind, conditioned by one's history and particular circumstances. [/p]\n\n[p]In the case of [i]expanded self-hood,[/i] where the experienced boundary between oneself and the external world is absent, it is common to become convinced that no such boundary ultimately exists. One may then believe that they are identical in nature to the universe as a unified whole, experiencing itself and expressing itself through a particular mind and body.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[headered-textbox id=\"increased-openness-to-experience\" header=\"Increased openness to experience\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][i]Increased openness to experience[/i] is a change in personality that is commonly reported after the experience of ego death. This change may occur as a result of feeling less obliged to conform to a particular identity, and thus becoming more likely to engage in novel experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]Alternatively, those who have undergone [i]personal bias suppression[/i] will also often find themselves more open to experiences that they may have previously disregarded due to preconceptions that were not fully grounded within reality.[/p][/headered-textbox]\n\n[hr/]\n\n[h2 id=\"subjective-differences-between-various-substances\"] Subjective differences between various substances [/h2]\n\n[p]Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] usage, ego death is most commonly triggered at heavy dosages by states of high level [int-link to=\"/effects/memory-suppression\"]memory suppression[/int-link] which cause the person to forget who they are. At other times however it can also be triggered by or in combination with [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] causing the person's consciousness to be completely consumed by information and therefore incapable of maintaining a stable sense of self. Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] usage, however, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy dosages by increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]cognitive disconnection[/int-link] causing a person to become entirely dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.[/p]\n\n[p]In terms of accompanying effects, psychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It also often synergizes with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity and interconnectedness[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.[/p]\n\n[p]In comparison however, dissociative ego death usually occurs alongside of high level [int-link to=\"/categories/disconnective-effects\"]sensory disconnection[/int-link] and out of body experiences, within [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]voids or holes[/int-link] filled with [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]hallucinatory structures[/int-link]. When compared to its dissociative equivalent, psychedelic egodeath is also typically much more likely to cause an anxious response within those who are inexperienced. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil whereas high dosage psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.[/p]\n\n[p]Outside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compound. For example, extremely heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link] such as DPH or datura can often result in ego death that is accompanied by [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link].

To give you a better sense of the experience, I've also done my best to accompany each aspect of these descriptions with as many relevant examples of pre-existing replications and visionary artwork from across the internet as possible. \n\nAs for the effect itself, Psychedelic Geometry is defined as the experience of a person's field of vision becoming partially or completely encompassed by ever-shifting, colourful, and incomprehensibly complex geometric patterns, form constants, phosphenes, shapes, fractals, and colours. This effect is extremely common at moderate to heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound. And It's also this particular effect that has likely had the biggest influence on the aesthetics which we have come to associate with psychedelic and visionary artwork.\n\nGeometry is rarely motionless and is generally continuously moving and constantly self-changing in its shape and style. During this process, the geometry naturally drifts across the visual field while fluidly transitioning through many distinct states and forms.\n\nIn terms of its complexity and vividness, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across seven approximate  levels of increasing intensity. These levels of intensity primarily increase in a manner which is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed, but can also be impacted by a wide variety of external factors such as a person's set and setting. \n\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 1\"|header=\"Visual Noise\"|labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At the lowest and least interesting level of intensity, geometry is at it's baseline complexity and has not yet taken form.
