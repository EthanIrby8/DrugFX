It results in objects and scenery appearing to progressively morph and warp in their size, shape, and configuration.[/p]\\n\\n[h3]Breathing[/h3]Breathing can be described as a style of visual drifting that results in objects and scenery appearing to steadily contract inwards and expand outwards in a consistent rhythm, similar to the lungs of a living organism.\\n[h3]Melting[/h3]Melting can be described as a style of visual drifting that results in the texture of objects and scenery appearing to completely or partially melt. It begins at lower intensities as a gradual distortion of an object\\'s texture which causes them to subtly droop, wobble, and lose their structural integrity. This gradually increases until it becomes impossible to ignore as the lines, textures, and colour between solid objects melt into one another in an extremely fluid style.\\n[h3]Flowing[/h3]Flowing can be described as a style of visual drifting that seems to occur almost exclusively on textures (particularly if they are highly detailed, complex, or rough in appearance). It results in the textures appearing to flow like a river in a seamless, looped animation. It is particularly common on wood grain or the fur of animals.\\n\\n[hr /]\\n\\n[h2]Levelling System[/h2]\\n[p]Regardless of sub-type, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across the 4 different levels of intensity described below:[/p]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 1\" header=\"Peripheral\" subHeader=\"Subtle Intensity\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At the lowest level, visual drifting can be described as a wiggling of straight lines within the external environment.

The imagery is manifested in varying levels of realism ranging from ill-defined and cartoon-like to wholly realistic.

It can be described as a short-term detachment from one’s immediate surroundings; during which, a person’s contact with reality is blurred and partially substituted by an ill-defined fantasy. The details of this internal visualisation are chosen in a slightly spontaneous or autonomous nature, but are mostly consciously controlled by the content of one’s current thought stream.[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\"Level 2\" header=\"Partially defined imagery\" labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]At this level, internal hallucinations consist of partially defined, blurred, and faded imagery within a person’s visual field.

For example, during the experience of internal hallucinations, it is possible to find oneself in a state that presents a relentless stream of intensely vivid hallucinations. This occurs at such a rapid rate that it eventually becomes psychologically exhausting to endure them, regardless of their thematic content. The sheer amount of content experienced in this state often results in powerful [int-link to=\"/effects/time-distortion?s=Time-dilation\"]time dilation[/int-link], which seems to stem from the fact that abnormally large amounts of experiences are being felt in very short periods of time. This is also consistently accompanied by states of sensory overload and [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-death\"]ego death[/int-link] in a manner that can subjectively feel as if it is a consequence of the brain allocating all of its processing power into rendering hallucinations at the expense of other cognitive faculties.\\n\\nThe content within these internal hallucinations can be further broken down into four distinct sub-components.

At its higher levels, these voids are often populated with hallucinatory structures, which are comprehensively described and documented in the subsection below.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Alongside this visual experience, changes in gravity and a powerful sense of tactile disconnection are also usually present. This can result in one feeling as if they are undergoing an out-of-body experience while weightlessly floating through a void over great distances in a variety of different speeds, directions, and orientations.

The structure can take any form, but usually appear as intricately shaped machine-like structures that are seemingly infinite in size and can convey huge amounts of innately understandable information.

In terms of how these structures shift between each other, their transition processes can be broken down into 4 basic categories. These are described and documented below:[/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n[li][b]Structural transformations[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by transforming or shapeshifting in a static and comprehensible way. This is something that usually unfolds in a gradual step-by-step morphing process.[/li]\\n[li][b]Structural panning[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by remaining completely static in their shape and simply panning out of view until they are no longer within one\\'s field of vision. It’s from here that another structure usually comes into view from outside of one\\'s peripheral vision within a few seconds to a couple of minutes.[/li]\\n[li][b]Structural disintegration[/b] - Structures can switch between each other by disassembling into many tiny sections that resemble pixels, or building blocks. This occurs in a manner that is reminiscent of smoke or dust blowing in the wind. When forming through this style, the structure will appear to assemble itself step-by-step, becoming increasingly complex as it occurs.[/li]\\n[li][b]Traveling over great distances[/b] - The third method of transitioning is experienced when the structures appear to be stationary whilst one is floating silently between them over what can feel like extreme physical distances. This floating is sometimes felt to occur on an invisible rail through the vast and infinite dissociative hole.\"[/li]\\n[/ul]',\n",

       " '[p] A [b]delusion[/b] is a false idea or belief that is held with strong conviction and subjective certainty and is inconsistent with an individual’s educational, cultural and social background.

[ref to=\"1\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"2\" no=\"1\" /][ref to=\"3\" no=\"1\" /] [/p]\\n\\n[p] Delusions are most commonly induced under the influence of heavy dosages of hallucinogenic compounds, such as [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants/\"]deliriants[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociatives[/int-link]. However, they can also occur to a lesser extent under the influence of cannabinoids, stimulant psychosis, and sleep deprivation. [/p]\\n\\n[p] This article focuses primarily on the types of delusion that are commonly induced with hallucinogens and other psychoactive substances. It therefore is not an exhaustive examination of all delusions listed within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that are known to occur to people who suffer from chronic psychological conditions, such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Substance-induced vs Disease-based Delusions [/h3]\\n\\n[p] When associated with psychoactive substance use, delusions tend to occur during the peak of a substance’s effect, though they may also occur as a result of withdrawal from substances such as benzodiazepines. In contrast to disease-based delusions, substance-induced delusions are often ‘broken-out of’ after the duration of the substance’s effect, or when they are provided enough evidence to contradict their delusion. It is rare for a delusion to persist after the effects of a substance have waned. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Overvalued Beliefs [/h3] \\n\\n[p] It is difficult to clearly define the boundary between ‘normal’ beliefs and the delusions that occur while on psychoactive substances. In the context of psychoactive substance use, there is a discernible continuum between beliefs held while sober and the fully delusional beliefs held by those experiencing psychosis. Beliefs which are overvalued though not delusional are commonly encountered at moderate substance intensity levels. Overvalued beliefs are those which are held with unusual fervency, but are not clearly absurd, such as the paranoid conviction that one’s friends are going to call emergency services imminently. With an increase in substance intensity overvalued beliefs can potentially develop into delusions proper. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Hypercertainty [/h3] \\n\\n[p] A common component to delusions and overvalued beliefs is a markedly increased sense of conviction in one’s beliefs. The intensity of this conviction roughly corresponds to the intensity of the substance’s effect. When conviction is increased, intuitive thinking is likewise increased, resulting in abnormally bold (and often tenuous) ideas and claims about science, metaphysics, politics, art and religion. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Types of delusion [/h3] \\n\\n[p] Although substance-induced delusions can occur in myriad forms, they can be often categorized as belonging to particular types, the most common of which are documented and described below: [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Grandiose Delusions [/h3]\\n\\n[p] [i]Grandiose delusions[/i] are those where there is an inflated sense of personal accomplishment or status, possibly as a product of effects experienced while under the influence of [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelics[/int-link] or stimulants, including [int-link to=\"/effects/ego-inflation\"]ego-inflation[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/mania\"]mania[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link]. These delusions persist for the duration of the substance’s effect, but will often be recognized as absurd upon obtaining sobriety. [/p]\\n\\n[p] Common grandiose themes include: [/p]\\n\\n[ul]\\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Transcension: [/b] The idea that one has ‘transcended to a higher level of being’ and is destined to solve the multitude of the world’s problems using extra-dimensional knowledge. [/li]\\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Enlightenment: [/b] The idea that one has obtained an enlightened or god-like status comparable to The Buddha or Jesus and now comprehends the simple answer to life, the universe and everything. This individual may make claims that they have obtained a permanent enlightened status, eliminated their ego, and shall become historically noteworthy. This delusion is more common amongst users of short-acting ego death inducing hallucinogenic substances, such as DMT, nitrous oxide and salvia. [/li]\\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Special Knowledge: [/b] The idea that one has figured out, due to their supreme genius, the mathematical, scientific, and philosophical problems that no one before them could. [/li]\\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Special Ability: [/b] The idea that one has obtained an (often supernatural) ability that few others have. This may include abilities such as telepathy, levitation or willing the universe into producing particular outcomes. [/li]\\n  [li] [b] Delusion of Precognizance [/b] The idea that one knows or can determine events that are bound to occur in the future. These predicted events can range from the mundane (‘My friend is going to call me.’) to the calamitous (‘Russia is about to invade the United States.’) [/li]\\n[/ul]\\n\\n[p] While these delusions are most often applied to the individual who is undergoing the effects of the substance, they may also be applied to others, such as believing a close friend is in some way extraordinary. This projection may be influenced by a disparity in psychological states, such as that between those who are sober and those under the influence of a psychoactive substance.

[/p]\\n\\n[h3] Delusions of Sobriety [/h3] \\n\\n[p] A [i]delusion of dobriety[/i] typically involves the falsely held belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment, significant [int-link to=\"/effects/motor-control-loss\"]motor control loss[/int-link], and an inability to fully communicate with others. [/p]\\n\\n[p] Delusions of sobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of GABAergic compounds such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. However, in many cases, this state of mind can stem not just from the delusional belief of one\\'s own sobriety, but also from a sense of denial that is motivated by a need to protect one\\'s ego, or a genuine inability to identify one\\'s own intoxication. [/p]\\n\\n[h3] Delusions of Permanent Unsobriety [/h3] \\n\\n[p] A [i]delusion of permanent unsobriety[/i] is the belief that has permanently changed the operation of their mind and will remain in an unsober state. This can also manifest as a fear that one has broken their brain through substance abuse, despite there being no convincing evidence to substantiate such a claim. [/p]\\n\\n[p] Delusions of permanent unsobriety are most commonly experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives/\"]dissociative[/int-link] and occasionally [int-link to=\"/summaries/psychedelics/cognitive\"]psychedelic[/int-link] compounds.

Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as inevitable and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment. [/li]\\n[li] The subjective perspective that one\\'s preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities are felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself.

For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” or a combination of their “ego” and physical body, during this state their sense of identity can change to include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. Alternatively, a person could feel as if their sense of self embodies nothing at all, which is an experience commonly referred to as ##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}.\\n\\nThere are a total of 5 distinct levels of identity which a person can experience. These various altered states of identity have been arranged into a levelling system that orders its different states from least to the most number of concepts one\\'s identity is currently attributed to. These levels are described and documented below:\\n##md{### 1. Total absence of attributed identity (depersonalization)}The lowest level of identity can be described as the sensation that there is a complete absence of having any sense of self at all. This is referred to in psychiatry as \"##int-link|to=\"/effects/depersonalization\"{depersonalization}\". It can be described as an anomaly of self-awareness that consists of a feeling of watching oneself act as one normally would, while also feeling is if they have no control over the situation. During this state, the affected person may feel that they are \"on autopilot\" and that the world has become vague, dreamlike, less real, or lacking in significance. Individuals who experience depersonalization often feel divorced from their own personal physicality by no longer sensing their body sensations, feelings, emotions, and behaviours as belonging to a person or identity. It is also often claimed by people who have depersonalization that reality seems unreal, distant or hazy. \\n\\nDepersonalization can sometimes be distressing to the user, who may become disoriented by the loss of a sense that their self is the origin of their thoughts and actions. However, it does not have to be an inherently negative altered state of awareness, as it does not directly affect one\\'s emotions or thought patterns.\\n\\nIt is perfectly normal for many people to slip into this state temporarily, often without even realizing it. For example, many people often note that they enter a detached state of autopilot during stressful situations or when performing monotonous routine tasks such as driving.\\n\\nWithin the context of identity-altering effects, depersonalization can be considered as being at the opposite end of the identity spectrum relative to states of ##int-link|to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"{unity and interconnectedness}. This is because, during depersonalization, a person senses and attributes their identity to nothing, giving a sense of having no self. However, during a state of unity and interconnectedness, one senses and attributes their identity to everything, giving a sense that the entirety of existence is their self.\\n\\nDepersonalization is often accompanied by other coinciding effects such as anxiety and a very similar psychological disorder known as derealization. It is most commonly induced under the influence of moderate dosages of ##int-link|to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"{dissociative} compounds, such as ketamine, PCP, and ##int-link|to=\"/substances/dxm/\"{DXM}. However, it can also occur to a lesser extent during the withdrawal symptoms of stimulants and depressants.\\n##md{### 2. Self-contained separate identity}The second level of identity can be described as feeling as if one\\'s identity is attributed to their brain and/or body. This is often said to feel as if one is a consciousness, the guiding force located within a body which is immersed in and interacting with a distinctly separate external environment. It is usually accompanied with a sense of free will or agency over all the thoughts and actions the person makes, which results in them feeling as if their decision-making processes are arising from an internal source which is not necessarily determined by cause and effect in the same manner as external systems.\\n\\nA self-contained separate identity is by far the most common form of identity. Mainstream Western cultural notions consider this conception of identity to be the self-evident and logical way to perceive the world as well as the only form of identity which isn\\'t intrinsically delusional. Despite being culturally normative, this belief has received considerable debate and criticism within modern neuroscience and philosophy.\\n\\nAlthough drastically altered in comparison to that of sobriety, it is also worth noting that hallucinatory states such as ego replacement and 2nd person ##int-link|to=\"/effects/perspective-hallucination\"{perspective hallucinations} typically still fall under the classification of this level. In both cases, a person still feels as if they are a separate agent facing the external world, but have the perception of being a different identity than their sober self.\\n##md{### 3. Identifying with specific \"external\" systems}The third level of identity alteration can be described as feeling as if one\\'s identity is attributed to (in addition to the body and/or brain) specific external systems or concepts within the immediate environment, particularly those that would usually be considered as intrinsically separate from one\\'s own being.\\n\\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the specific physical systems or concepts within the perceivable external environment which are currently the subjects of their thoughts or focus. This creates a sensation of becoming inextricably \"connected to\", \"one with\", \"the same as\", or \"unified\" with whatever the perceived external system happens to be.\\n\\nThere are an endless number of ways in which this level manifests itself, but common examples of the experience often include:\\n\\n##md{- Becoming unified with and identifying with a specific object one is interacting with.\\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with another person or multiple people, particularly common if engaging in sexual or romantic activities.\\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the entirety of one\\'s own physical body.\\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with large crowds of people, particularly common at raves and music festivals.\\n- Becoming unified with and identifying with the external environment, but not the people within it.}\\nThis level of identity alteration most commonly occurs during intense states of focus, meditation, or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\\n##md{### 4. Identifying with all perceivable \"external\" systems}The fourth level of identity alteration can be defined as feeling as if one\\'s identity is attributed to the entirety of their immediately perceivable external environment.\\n\\nThe experience itself is often described as a loss of perceived boundaries between a person’s identity and the entirety of their sensory input or the currently perceivable external environment. It creates a sensation in the person that they have “become one with their surroundings.” This is felt to be the result of a person’s sense of self becoming attributed to not just primarily the internal narrative of the ego, but in equal measure to the body itself and everything around it which it is physically perceiving through the senses. This sensation creates the compelling perspective that the person is the external environment experiencing itself through a specific point within it, namely the physical sensory perceptions of the body their consciousness currently resides in.\\n\\nIt is at this point that a key component of the high-level identity alteration experience becomes an extremely noticeable factor. Once a person\\'s sense of self has become attributed to the entirety of their surroundings, this new perspective completely changes how it feels to physically interact with what was previously felt to be an external environment. For example, when a person is not in this state and is interacting with a physical object, it typically feels as though they are a central agent acting on the separate world around them.\\n\\nHowever, while undergoing a state of unity with the currently perceivable environment, interacting with an external object consistently feels as if the whole unified system is autonomously acting on itself with no central, separate agent operating the process of interaction.

People who undergo this experience consistently interpret it as the removal of a deeply embedded illusion, with the revelation often described as some sort of supposedly profound “awakening” or “enlightenment.”\\n\\nAlthough they are not necessarily literal truths about reality, at this point, many commonly reported conclusions of a religious and metaphysical nature often begin to manifest themselves as profound realizations. These are described below:\\n\\n##md{- The sudden and total acceptance of death as a fundamental complement of life. Death is no longer felt to be the destruction of a person, but simply the end of this specific point of a greater whole, which has always existed and will continue to exist and live on through everything else in which it resides. Therefore, the death of a small part of the whole is seen as an inevitable, and not worthy of grief or any emotional attachment, but simply a fact of reality.\\n- The subjective perspective that the person\\'s preconceived notions of \"god\" or deities can be felt as identical to the nature of existence and the totality of its contents, including oneself. This typically entails the intuition that if the universe contains all possible power (omnipotence), all possible knowledge (omniscience), is self-creating, and self-sustaining then on either a semantic or literal level the universe and its contents could also be viewed as god.\\n- The subjective perspective that the person, by nature of being the universe, is personally responsible for the design, planning, and implementation of every single specific detail and plot element of one\\'s personal life, the history of humanity, and the entirety of the universe. This naturally includes personal responsibility for all of humanity\\'s sufferings and flaws but also includes its acts of love and achievements.}\\nThis state most commonly occurs during intense states of well-practiced meditation or under the influence of hallucinogens such as psychedelics.\\n##md{#### Further reading}Similar accounts of the experience of unity with the universe and the apparent illusory nature of the self can be found across a surprisingly large variety of independent religious, philosophical, and psychological sources.

During this form of ego death, there is a profound experience of remaining fully conscious, while there is no longer an “I” experiencing one\\'s sensory input; there is just the sensory input as it is and by itself, without a conscious agent to comment on or think about what is happening to it.[/p][/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\"Type 2\" header=\"Objectified selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\\n[p]An [b]objective selfhood[/b] can be described as the experience of the person remaining aware of the existence of oneself, while no longer perceiving themselves as integrally attached to their sense of identity. Instead of feeling that they and their sense of selfhood are a unified whole which is the subject of experience, their awareness instead feels entirely separate from it\\'s own sense of self, as if this selfhood is now the object of experience instead of the subject.[/p][/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox label=\"Type 3\" header=\"Expanded selfhood\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\\n[p]An [b]expanded selfhood[/b] can be described as the experience of one\\'s sense of identity becoming constituted by a wider array of concepts than it previously did. For example, while a person may usually feel that they are exclusively their “ego” and physical body, this effect can cause their sense of identity to also include the external environment or an object they are interacting with. This results in intense and inextricable feelings of unity or interconnectedness between oneself and varying arrays of previously \"external\" systems.

These responses and alterations can occur both during the experience of ego death, but also in the hours, days, or weeks afterwards. [/p]\\n\\n[p]A few of the most common examples of this phenomenon are described and listed below:[/p]\\n\\n[headered-textbox header=\"Rejuvenation\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][int-link to=\"/effects/rejuvenation\"]Rejuvenation[/int-link] is a feeling of mild to extreme cognitive refreshment which is usually felt once the experience of ego death is over and the person has also fully recovered from the trip as a whole. The symptoms of rejuvenation often include a sustained sense of heightened mental clarity, increased emotional stability, increased calmness, mindfulness, increased motivation, personal bias suppression, increased focus, and decreased depression. At its highest level, feelings of rejuvenation can become so intense that they manifest as the profound and overwhelming sensation of being \"reborn\" anew. Within the context of ego death, rejuvenation often feels as if it has occurred in a manner which is akin to that of rebooting a computer.[/p]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox header=\"Personal Bias Suppression\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\\n[p][int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]Personal bias suppression[/int-link] is a decrease in the personal or cultural biases, preferences, and associations a person knowingly or unknowingly filters and interprets their perception of the world through. Within the context of ego death, personal bias suppression feels as if it occurs due to some sort of baseline resetting of the contexts which the ego increasingly attributes to concepts over time. This often results in the feeling of processing concepts from a neutral perspective completely untainted by past memories, prior experiences, contexts, and biases.[/p]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox header=\"Overcoming fear of death\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"]\\n[p][b]Overcoming the fear of death[/b] is very a common conclusion and feeling that is associated with ego death, with those who have undergone ego death often reporting that they not only \"experienced what it is like to die\", but also became both accustomed to and substantially less afraid of the prospect. This is seemingly because the experience of letting go during ego death and willfully surrendering one\\'s own sense of self is often likened to that of the preconceived notions that many people hold about what it is like to die.[/p]\\n[/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox header=\"Fear of losing control\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p]A [b]fear of losing control[/b] is a very common occurrence when a person that undergoes ego death is not emotionally prepared, not in an appropriate set or setting, or is simply unwilling to relinquish their sense of selfhood. During this experience, the person will often find themselves experiencing overwhelming fear and anxiety relating to the fear of losing control. This fear and anxiety is especially common in those who have not experienced ego death before. [/p]\\n\\n[p]In order to overcome this fear, it is recommended that the person does their best to stop fighting the loss of control, and simply surrender themselves to the experience of ego death.

These insights may take a number of forms. For example, in the case of [b]absent[/b] and [b]objectified self-hood[/b], one may conclude that the ego is not an essential component of who they are. Instead, it may come to be known as a construct of the mind, conditioned by one\\'s history and particular circumstances. [/p]\\n\\n[p]In the case of [b]expanded self-hood,[/b] where the experienced boundary between oneself and the external world is absent, it is common to become convinced that no such boundary ultimately exists. One may then believe that they are identical in nature to the universe as a unified whole, experiencing itself and expressing itself through a particular mind and body.[/p][/headered-textbox]\\n\\n[headered-textbox header=\"Increased openness to experience\" labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\" headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"][p][b]Increased openness to experience[/b] is a change in personality that is commonly reported after the experience of ego death.

At other times however it can also be triggered by or in combination with [int-link to=\"/effects/sensory-overload\"]sensory overload[/int-link] causing the person\\'s consciousness to be completely consumed by information and therefore incapable of maintaining a stable sense of self. Within the context of [int-link to=\"/summaries/dissociatives\"]dissociative[/int-link] usage, however, ego death seems to be triggered at heavy dosages by increasingly intense [int-link to=\"/effects/cognitive-disconnection\"]cognitive disconnection[/int-link] causing a person to become entirely dissociated from cognitive functions such as the maintenance of a sense of identity.[/p]\\n\\n[p]In terms of accompanying effects, psychedelic ego death usually occurs alongside states of level 6-7 [int-link to=\"/effects/geometry\"]geometry[/int-link] and [int-link to=\"/effects/internal-hallucination\"]internal hallucinations[/int-link] of an intense and often overwhelming nature. It also often synergizes with other coinciding effects such as [int-link to=\"/effects/personal-bias-suppression\"]personal bias suppression[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/unity-and-interconnectedness\"]unity and interconnectedness[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/spirituality-enhancement\"]spirituality enhancement[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link]. These accompanying effects further elevate the subjective intensity and transpersonal significance of ego death experiences.[/p]\\n\\n[p]In comparison however, dissociative ego death usually occurs alongside of high level [int-link to=\"/categories/disconnective-effects\"]sensory disconnection[/int-link] and out of body experiences, within [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=holes-spaces-voids\"]voids or holes[/int-link] filled with [int-link to=\"/categories//effects/visual-disconnection?s=structures\"]hallucinatory structures[/int-link]. When compared to its dissociative equivalent, psychedelic egodeath is also typically much more likely to cause an anxious response within those who are inexperienced. This is because many people experience dissociatives as inherently calming and tranquil whereas high dosage psychedelics are quite often experienced as the opposite.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Outside of psychedelics and dissociatives, it is also possible to experience ego death under the influence of a few other classes of psychoactive compound. For example, extremely heavy dosages of [int-link to=\"/summaries/deliriants\"]deliriants[/int-link] such as DPH or datura can often result in ego death that is accompanied by [int-link to=\"/effects/delusion\"]delusions[/int-link], [int-link to=\"/effects/psychosis\"]psychosis[/int-link], and [int-link to=\"/effects/external-hallucination\"]external hallucinations[/int-link].

Although these two classes of hallucinogen function very differently on both a subjective and neuropharmacological level, both of their equivalents to ego death feel as if they stem from different forms of a break down or deterioration in the brains ability to maintain normal levels of cognitive functioning.[/p]',\n",

In this video I am going to comprehensively discuss, describe, and document the specific visual subjective effect which is known as ##i{psychedelic geometry}. \\n\\nThis will be in accordance with the terminology laid out within our comprehensive Subjective Effect Index and will be done without resorting to metaphors, analogies, or personal trip reports. To give you a better sense of the experience, I\\'ve also done my best to accompany each aspect of these descriptions with as many relevant examples of pre-existing replications and visionary artwork from across the internet as possible. \\n\\nAs for the effect itself, Psychedelic Geometry is defined as the experience of a person\\'s field of vision becoming partially or completely encompassed by ever-shifting, colourful, and incomprehensibly complex geometric patterns, form constants, phosphenes, shapes, fractals, and colours. This effect is extremely common at moderate to heavy dosages of almost any psychedelic compound. And It\\'s also this particular effect that has likely had the biggest influence on the aesthetics which we have come to associate with psychedelic and visionary artwork.\\n\\nGeometry is rarely motionless and is generally continuously moving and constantly self-changing in its shape and style. During this process, the geometry naturally drifts across the visual field while fluidly transitioning through many distinct states and forms.\\n\\nIn terms of its complexity and vividness, this effect is capable of manifesting itself across seven approximate  levels of increasing intensity. These levels of intensity primarily increase in a manner which is proportional to the dosage of the substance consumed, but can also be impacted by a wide variety of external factors such as a person\\'s set and setting. \\n\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 1\"|header=\"Visual Noise\"|labelBackground=\"#AAAAAA\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At the lowest and least interesting level of intensity, geometry is at it\\'s baseline complexity and has not yet taken form. It is thus only perceived as faint visual noise, snow or static. This is usually seen primarily with closed eyes or within dark environments.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 2\"|header=\"Motion and Colour\"|labelBackground=\"#a4a3a3\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, the visual snow and static begins to form into unstructured regions of moving colour clouds that are also usually seen primarily with closed eyes or within dark environments. These are comparable to a more distinct version of the common phenomena known as phosphenes, which can easily be experienced during a sober state by simply rubbing or applying pressure onto one\\'s closed eyes.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 3\"|header=\"Partially Defined Geometry\"|labelBackground=\"#9e9d9c\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, relatively complex two-dimensional shapes and patterns with a vague and somewhat blurred structure begin to form. \\n\\nGeometry at this level is smaller in size with a darker colour palette that typically limits itself to only a few different shades, such as blacks, reds, and dark purples. \\n\\nThey are also visible with eyes both opened *and* closed as a flat overlay upon the visual field. However, at this level they still remain significantly more detailed with closed eyes or within dark environments.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 4\"|header=\"Fully Defined Geometry\"|labelBackground=\"#8f8e8d\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, the detail in which the geometry displays itself becomes profoundly complex and fully structured, but still remains mostly two-dimensional. The geometry also becomes larger in size and extremely intricate in its detail, with a nearly limitless colour palette. \\n\\nThese patterns are displayed across a flat veil of geometry that floats directly in front of a person\\'s vision, still remaining slightly more visible with the eyes closed, or in dark environments.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 5\"|header=\"3-Dimensional Geometry\"|labelBackground=\"#7a7a79\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, the geometry has become fully three-dimensional in both its structure and general positioning throughout the external environment. \\n\\nThis adds a new layer of visual complexity and leaves the geometric forms sprawled out across the surfaces and objects of a person’s environment, instead of merely displaying themselves across a basic and flat veil in front of one’s visual field.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 6\"|header=\"Partially overriding visual perception\"|labelBackground=\"#6d6d6c\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, the geometry has become so intense, vivid, and bright that it has started to block out and replace the external world. The visual perception of a person’s environment begins to be replaced by geometry, with objects and scenery either transforming into complex geometric structures or simply being blocked out and covered by them. \\n\\nThis occurs in a manner that drastically impairs the use of a person’s normal vision. From this level onwards, it is also possible to experience geometry which is interpreted as ineffable, non-euclidean, or impossible in its shape and structure.}\\n##headered-textbox|label=\"Level 7\"|header=\"All-encompassing\"|labelBackground=\"#555554\"|headerBackground=\"#F0F0F0\"{At this level, the geometry continues to become even more intense, vivid, and bright as it begins to block out or replace the external world, completely impairing a person’s sense of normal sight. Often to the point where the user will often become incapable of telling whether their eyes are open or closed. \\n\\nThis creates the perception that one is no longer within the external environment, but has “broken through” into another reality of extremely complex and otherworldly geometric forms.}\\n\\nOutside of any specific levels of intensity, the more intricate and pronounced psychedelic geometry becomes, the more likely it is that these geometric forms will become structured and organized in a manner that presents genuine information to the person experiencing them, far beyond the perception of meaningless (although complex) shapes and colours. \\n\\nFor example, the geometry may begin to condense itself into complex internal hallucinations which are usually comprised entirely from the psychedelic geometry itself. These internal hallucinations will have to be covered in more detail within a future video, but can include anything from complex settings, scenes, imagery, autonomous entities, and much much more.\\n\\nAlong side of this, psychedelic geometry can also form into extraordinarily detailed and innately understandable structures that feel as if they convey or represent specific concepts and neurological processes that occur within the brain. Unfortunately, however, due to it\\'s inherently cognitive components, this particular aspect of high level geometry is completely impossible to accurately replicate via any traditional means.']"

       "['[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Within the psychonautic community and DMT users in particular, autonomous entities are commonly viewed as one of the most captivating aspects of the psychedelic experience. They are often shrouded in esoteric mystery, to the point that a significant portion of the people who encounter them will go as far as speculating (or even asserting) that these experiences are not simply fabrications of the mind but rather beings from another world that exist independently of the human brain. This is a viewpoint that was further popularized by the likes of Terrence McKenna, who famously theorised that the \"[ext-link to=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJjR3aUhsOk&ab_channel=WePlantsAreHappyPlants\"]machine-elves[/ext-link]\" he encountered under the influence of DMT were either extraterrestrial in nature, interdimensional beings from a higher plane of existence, time-traveling humans from the future, or an arcology of souls that includes both our ancestors and those who have yet to be born.[/p]\\n\\t \\n[p]As far as I can tell, the most common reasonings behind this viewpoint are that the experience of encountering these entities is often interpreted as feeling more realistic and well defined than that of any sober experience the person has ever had. Alongside this, there is often a sense that the encounter itself is so incomprehensibly complex and otherworldly that there is simply no possible way that the human brain could generate such an experience on its own. In regards to this particular notion, it is then often asserted that consciousness must be an antenna of sorts that receives either all or some of its subjective experiences from that of an unknown interdimensional source. Furthermore, the source of this received input is sometimes said to be adjustable depending on the person\\'s brain state, with substances such as psychedelics simply tuning our consciousness into the analogous equivalent of a different radio station or TV channel. This is an idea that was once again further popularised by Terence Mckenna, who was famously quoted as saying: \"I don\\'t believe consciousness is generated in the brain any more than television programs are made inside my TV. The box is too small.\"[/p]\\n\\t \\n[p]While I can personally empathise with the reasons that some people may be drawn into these conclusions after the often earth-shattering experience of a DMT trip or other high-level psychedelic experience, I do not personally believe that autonomous entities are anything more than profound but ultimately hallucinated products of the subconscious mind. Instead, I am quite sure that they are simply the psychedelic equivalent of the various characters and beings that most people commonly encounter within their dreams. Although it could be argued that autonomous entities are too characteristically different from that of dream characters to possibly be a result of the same neurological processes, I think that these differences in their appearance and behaviour are largely the result of the many other psychedelic effects that are simultaneously occurring during these encounters. The most notable one is geometry, which causes the hallucination to be comprised of the otherworldly shapes and patterns that provide autonomous entities with their distinctly \"hyperspatial\" aesthetic. Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially synergise into an experience that is easy to misinterpret as something occurring outside of the human mind.[/p]\\n\\t \\n[p]On a less important note, I also think it\\'s interesting to consider that the leveling system for communication styles that\\'s listed above can not only be applied to autonomous entities but can also be applied to the experience of dream characters without any necessary modifications to its wordings. This was completely unintentional and is, in my opinion, not a coincidence.[/p]\\n\\t \\n[p]If autonomous entities were truly something that exists beyond the human mind, there would likely be at least a single verifiable case of them conveying information to a person that they did not already know or could not have come to the conclusion of within that moment. This would also likely be testable to some degree, which has led me, my wife, and my close friends to casually experiment with asking DMT entities a variety of questions over the years. These questions have included math problems, metaphysical questions, philosophical questions, and queries pertaining to their general nature as beings inhabiting their particular world. However, each attempt at doing so has resulted in the entities simply ignoring the question, arrogantly scoffing at the absurdity of us asking them such a trivial thing, or replying with vague ambiguous wording that the person\\'s own mind could have easily come up with. This has even been the case when the entities are presenting themselves as vastly more complex, knowledgeable, and powerful than the humans that they are interacting with.[/p]\\n\\t \\n[p]However, while I do believe that autonomous entities are a result of a similar process to that of dream characters, I do not want to be reductive and downplay the often overwhelmingly profound nature of this experience. For example, within the moment that entities are presenting themselves, I believe that to varying degrees, they are genuinely conscious agents that the brain is simulating alongside our own. It does not seem unreasonable to me that if the brain can simulate one conscious agent during everyday sobriety, that in certain extenuating circumstances, such as mental illnesses, dream states, and hallucinogenic experiences, it could also temporarily allocate resources into simultaneously simulating other conscious agents. [/p]\\n\\n[p]Many autonomous entities would pass the [ext-link to=\"/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test\"]Turing test[/ext-link] if interviewed. I find this particularly fascinating in conjunction with the knowledge that they also commonly present themselves as representative embodiments of various aspects of the subconscious mind. These aspects can include things such as: facets of our personality, emotions, neurological processes, past experiences, and specific concepts. Although I may well be wrong, this suggests to me that at least to some extent, this experience may therefore allow people to potentially interact and communicate with facets of their consciousness in a manner that would otherwise be entirely impossible without the use of hallucinogenic substances.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Internal hallucinations are easily one of the most highly sought after effects within the hallucinogenic experience. At their higher levels, they can offer a near infinite wealth of experiences and show people things so unfathomable that it will often cause them to question how these hallucinations could possibly even originate from their own mind. It has always fascinated me that the brain is quite capable of instantaneously rendering scenes and images that are so detailed, intricate, and vivid that they are often incomprehensible beyond anything that could ever occur within the real world.[/p]\\n\\n[p]However, after a lot of contemplation and experiences with both hallucinatory states and lucid dreaming, I now strongly suspect that internal hallucinations are quite likely to be the drug induced equivalent of the various scenes that most people commonly encounter within their [int-link to=\"/effects/dreams/\"]dreams[/int-link]. This is because there are a number of interesting commonalities between dreams and hallucinations that are too substantial for me to ignore. For example, I think it is interesting that when leaving something such as a sudden onset hallucination, there is often a feeling of amnesia that\\'s identical to the feeling of waking up from a dream. Alongside of this, there is often an identical sense of plot acceptance within both dreams and hallucinations that results in the person immediately accepting their current situation as a real life event.[/p]\\n\\n[p]From personal experience, I can also confirm that the well established \"reality checks\" that can be used within Lucid Dreams to determine whether or not one is currently awake or asleep, do in fact work just as well within high-level drug induced hallucinations. For example, within a dream, subtle details such as written text and clock faces are seemingly incapable of rendering in a static manner. So if a person looks at one of these things, takes note of them, looks away, and then looks back, they will find without fail that the content suddenly changes its appearance each and every single time. This is also true for internal hallucinations in exactly the same manner.[/p]\\n\\n[p]On a less important note, I think it\\'s interesting to consider that the leveling system listed above can not only be applied to internal hallucinations, but can also be applied to the experience of hypnagogia and fully fledged dreams without any significant modifications to its wording. Alongside of this, the levelling system that I devised to measure the coherency of an autonomous entities communication methods can also be perfectly applied to that of dream characters without any modification at all. This was completely unintentional for both of these leveling systems and is, in my personal opinion, not a coincidence.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Although it could be argued that internal hallucinations are too characteristically different from that of dreams to possibly stem from the similar neurological processes, I think that these differences in their presentation are largely the result of the many other effects that are often simultaneously occurring during these experiences.

Alongside of this, various other subjective effects such as synaesthesia, machinescapes, recursion, time distortion, and transpersonal states can all potentially further synergize with the experience.[/p]\\n\\n[p]However, I am fully aware that this position is merely one of pure speculation and that I cannot prove this definitively. As the years go by, I am therefore hoping that further scientific research and study into this topic will be able to help elucidate the precise neurological causes behind this fascinating experience.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Unspeakable horrors are an effect that I am intimately familiar with. They were at one point the primary style of hallucinatory content that I experienced under the influence of heavy dosages of psychedelics.[/p] \\n\\n[p]I first experienced this effect on a 30mg dose of 2C-P and was absolutely astounded that my brain could produce Lovecraftian-esque images and scenery that were so incomprehensibly horrifying to look upon they would leave me genuinely concerned for the fabric of my sanity. However, despite how deeply unsettling they were, I always found them to be thrilling, similar to the feeling of watching a horror film or riding a rollercoaster. In fact, once they were over, I would consistently find they had not damaged my psyche in any discernible way and had actually left me feeling emotionally stronger due to the realisation that I was capable enough to endure them.[/p]\\n\\n[p]It\\'s worth clarifying to the various people that have contacted me about this that I do not believe this effect can manifest spontaneously without any apparent prior causes. Through personal experience and discussion with others who have undergone this state, it seems that unspeakable horrors are a direct result of a person\\'s emotional state being in a place that is deeply unstable and hopeless. There was a two year period in which psychedelic hallucinations would manifest in this manner for me. At the time, I was suffering from extreme depression, daily suicidal ideation, overwhelming social anxiety, and the realisation that my life was metaphorically collapsing around me. Now that I\\'m in a place where I\\'m more emotionally stable and content with life than I\\'ve ever been, these horrifying hallucinations no longer occur for me regardless of the substance I ingest or its dosage.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"]\\n[p]Visual geometry was the aspect of the psychedelic experience that most quickly convinced me that these substances are incredibly profound and essential tools for humanity. Almost a decade ago as a young 17-year-old undergoing my first couple of hallucinogenic experiences, I found myself immediately fascinated by the sheer incomprehensibility of the beautiful patterns which my mind was producing. Not only were these geometric patterns complex beyond anything I had ever seen, but they were so impossibly complex in their forms that I perhaps naively believed if even a short recording of high-level geometry could be somehow brought back to the real world, it would change the face of society forever.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Based on my personal experiences, I firmly believe that geometry is not simply another form of hallucination, but instead a result of neurological signals and processes from various regions of the brain bleeding into the visual cortex and being reinterpreted as complex geometric forms in a manner which is comparable to that of synaesthesia. This would explain multiple aspects of the effects behaviour, such as the way in which geometry commonly feels as if it is an innately understandable visual representation of one\\'s emotional state, sensory input, and even complex concepts or thoughts. If this is true, it implies that psychedelic geometry is the profound experience of being able to indirectly see the hidden architecture and complex programming of human consciousness.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Another aspect of geometry that myself and others have found very intriguing is that psychedelic geometry often follows the aesthetic themes of various artwork and writing styles from historical societies, such as Aztecs, Mayans, Egyptians, Tibetans, etc.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Based purely upon my own potentially flawed speculation, there are a couple of relatively plausible explanations behind this. Perhaps our culture simply associates psychedelia with mysticism and ancient societies in a manner which results in these themes displaying themselves within our collective experience of psychedelic geometry. Perhaps these societies experienced the very same imagery under the influence of psychedelic plants and took inspiration from this within their artwork, architecture, and alphabets. Maybe psychedelic geometry manifests itself in a manner which is, on some level, a visual representation of the same neurological processes that allowed ancient humans to create language and artwork in the first place, thus generating a variety of somewhat consistent aesthetic themes throughout the humans that experience them, regardless of their cultural or historical context.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Nevertheless, none of these speculative ideas feel particularly satisfactory to me, but I do still hope that this particular aspect of psychedelic geometry is more closely examined and understood on a a scientific level within my lifetime.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Dissociative holes are easily one my favourite deep hallucinogenic states that can be reliably induced. They are a place that I find myself wanting to visit time and time again, particularly under the influence of ketamine or DXM. With holing, as it is more colloquially known, I find myself with a distinct feeling of \"coming home\" every single time I re-enter this incredibly unique state of consciousness. For me, this is likely due to its accompanying headspace consistently leaving me feeling not just amazed, but extremely tranquil and serene in a manner that equivalent doses of psychedelics rarely come close to.[/p]\\n\\n[p]The K-hole and it\\'s numerous other dissociative induced counterparts are an entirely different world to that of a high dose psychedelic experience. However, despite this state often being overlooked and underestimated by many passionate psychonauts, it is completely equal in its depth. It is absolutely awe inspiring to float, fall, rise, and sink through endless darkened voids and caverns while gazing upon vast everchanging and monolithic structures.  Although this place may not be as unfathomably complex as an equivalent psychedelic state, the sheer scale of these hallucinations are truly breathtaking in their own way.[/p]\\n\\n[p]While heavy doses of psychedelics reliably force me to directly confront my problems in a manner that makes it near impossible to use them as an emotional crutch, dissociative substances simply do not do this to nearly the same extent. While I certainly experience deep states of introspection during this state, repeatedly entering it as frequently as I can does not inevitably punish me in the same way that psychedelics would under similar circumstances. In fact, this state of mind feels like a true escape from reality in a manner that has proven irresistibly alluring for me in the past. It is because of this that I would recommend any psychonaut who is burdened with emotional instability and an addictive personality to tread carefully when exploring this state of consciousness with any regularity.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Outside of miscalculating the amount of substance that the person is consuming, dosage independent intensity seems to be quite a rare event. However, I have heard a number of credible accounts over the years from friends, as well as a first hand experience, that truly felt as if it defied all conventional models of pharmacology.[/p]\\n\\n[p]For example, my own experience with this was under the influence of a very non-traditional ayahuasca brew. During this phase of my life, my entire circle of friends had taken to no longer bothering to brew mimosa hostilis root bark over the course of several hours into a foul tasting liquid, but were instead simply blending the product into a fine, stringy powder and masking it within banana smoothies. In conjunction with Syrian Rue taken 45 minutes beforehand, this worked incredibly well and allowed all of us to use ayahuasca in a surprisingly accessible and casual manner. On this particular night, it was my friends birthday and the two of us were planning on tripping together to celebrate it. However, when we finally got around to consuming the root bark smoothie, a single tiny strand of the root bark immediately got stuck in the back of my throat on the first sip and made me almost vomit to the point where I knew that I could not drink any further and would not be tripping tonight. I had consumed what I would estimate to be less than 1% out of what was likely in the 15 gram range of material.[/p]\\n\\n[p]However, as we waited for my friend to come up on what was quite a heavy dosage, I began to notice that I was also coming up at the same rate and intensity as him. I was experiencing incredibly intense geometry to the point where I was having trouble seeing the room around me, alongside intense visual distortions and a multitude of cognitive effects. While this was happening, I heard a voice in my head tell me that I was being allowed to trip at this level despite my miniscule dosage because it was my friends birthday and that it would be more conducive for him to have an enjoyable evening if we were both tripping. At the time, this absolutely blew my mind and continues to baffle me to this very day.[/p]\\n\\n[p]While I am not sure what could have caused this experience, I suspect it was because I had used ayahuasca several times before and that despite the dosage, some sort of unknown subconscious process was apparently both present and actively capable of allowing that door in my mind to open regardless. From what I have gathered, other accounts of this seem to follow similar themes that, in my opinion, have some potentially interesting implications in regards to how the subconscious mind can impact a psychedelic experience and to what extent.[/p][/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]This particular subjective effect component may not be the most profound, therapeutic, or spiritual state of mind available within the hallucinogenic experience. However, in my personal opinion, it is quite likely to be one of the most uniquely baffling and inexplicable effects when it comes to both undergoing it and considering the causes behind it. While I may not have a particularly in-depth academic knowledge of neurology and psychopharmacology, the vast majority of subjective effects that occur under the influence of hallucinogenic substances at least have some sort of vaguely plausible mechanism or cause that I can immediately speculate upon. In contrast, however, I have struggled for years to come up with a satisfying hypothesis on why Salvia Divinorum can cause human brains to quite reliably create states in which a person\\'s awareness and felt bodily form suddenly becomes enveloped by rotating panels, conveyer belts, pulleys, gears, and all manner of other interlocking mechanical parts.[/p]\\n\\n[p]At face value, I would initially assume that machinescapes are simply a type of hallucination that occurs among people as a result of the cultural influence of living in a world in which we are all acutely aware of the existence of machinery. However, the fact that this experience is so consistently reported by people under the influence of a very specific compound leads me to believe that there is at least a little more to it than that. This is especially interesting to consider in the context of Salvia Divinorum\\'s unique pharmacology, in which it functions as a potent k-opioid receptor agonist. While the k-opioid receptor system is not well understood, it is known that these receptors have the highest prevalence within the claustrum, a system that is the most densely connected structure in the brain and that\\'s been shown to have widespread activity throughout numerous cortical components. These are associated with playing key roles in consciousness, higher cognitive functioning, and sustained attention. It is further theorised that the claustrum harmonises and coordinates activity in various parts of the cortex in a manner that leads to the seamlessly integrated nature of subjective conscious experience. All of this suggests to me that this unique hallucinogen is creating disruptions and changes to brain function that occur on a much deeper, widespread, and fundamental level than that of psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.[/p]\\n\\n[p]When taking this knowledge into consideration, I am led to suspect that machinescapes may occur under the influence of salvia due to the way this substance reliably disrupts consciousness on an all-encompassing level. If I had to guess I would say that this could potentially cause the experience of machinescapes to occur in a number of ways. For example, perhaps it causes the brain\\'s internal map of the bodies form to reassemble in complex and unpredictable ways, which are then accompanied by visual hallucinations that are commonly interpreted as interlocking mechanical parts. It may also trigger data from various parts of the brain to spill over into areas in unusual and complex ways, that they would usually otherwise not, resulting in this data being interpreted as a more simplistic but mechanical-esque equivalent to psychedelic geometry accompanied by an equivalent tactile sensation. It could also potentially be a unique form of internal hallucination that the brain will often render when it is largely incapable of drawing from its memory database of more coherent everyday concepts. Alternatively, however, this experience may be a result of a combination of these factors, or an entirely different process altogether.

It started as a young teenager when I began to realise that I no longer felt as if I was myself or that I even had a sense of self, alongside the sensation that my entire body and consciousness was in a state of mechanical autopilot. However, at the age of 17, my feelings of depersonalisation were spontaneously eradicated during a single LSD trip. This experience returned my sense of selfhood and gave me the profound sensation that I was not an electrochemical machine responding to external sensory input with fully pre-programmed responses. Instead, I realised that I was, in fact, a conscious agent living in an external world and completely capable of making my own choices through the application of free will, a state of mind which I have come to realise most people take entirely for granted. [/p]\\n\\n[p] Although this feeling of \"normalcy\" lasted the better part of 3 years, it eventually began to fade back into depersonalisation. It\\'s been 6 years now and I have not experienced that sense of selfhood or free will since I was a teenager. I\\'ve given up hope that I ever will again. However, it\\'s important to note that despite this persistent and continuous depersonalisation, my ability to function and live a happy life remains completely unaffected. This has left me with the impression that those who experience fear or disorientation when undergoing this state are not experiencing feelings that are intrinsic to the condition itself, but are instead responding to a forced change in their culturally embedded assumptions on the nature of human identity.

       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Perception of eternalism is one of a handful of subjective effect components that has had a substantial impact on how I view myself and the universe around me. I first experienced this effect during a state of level 4 unity and interconnectedness while under the influence of a heavy dose of Ayahuasca. It was one of the most profound experiences of my entire life. I truly felt that not only was I the entirety of existence experiencing itself through this body, but that this moment and all other moments would continue to exist eternally within their specific time frames. Although I am acutely aware of how it is impossible for me to genuinely know if this is true or not, I have found it to be a perspective that is very difficult to shake off after having this experience a number of times.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Before experiencing this effect, I had never considered or even heard of the various similar metaphysical schools of thought that exist as relatively mainstream concepts within the field of philosophy. However, after having had experienced this state of mind numerous times, I happened upon a large number of relevant concepts that include ideas such as eternalism, four dimensionalism, growing block universe, perdurantism, and the b-theory of time. Each of these concepts have their Wikipedia articles linked to within the See Also section of this page. [/p]\\n\\n[p]As an intellectual concept, the B-theory of time is especially interesting to me as it is relatively well supported by the physics community. In summary, B-theory posits that the flow of time is an illusion, that the past, present, and future are equally real and that time is tenseless. Its support is seemingly due to its apparent compatibility with theoretical physics and the fact that many theories such as special relativity, the ADD model, and brane cosmology are considered to point to a theory of time similar to B-theory. However, I feel that it is important to note that I do not have a remotely in-depth understanding of theoretical physics and that although these theories are in support of notions similar to this experience, I am not entirely sure that their ontological implications can be asserted within science and outside the realm of philosophy or metaphysics.[/p]\\n\\n[p]Regardless of whether or not the nature of time is genuinely illusory, it is truly fascinating to me that without any prior knowledge, myself and many other psychedelic users can experience incredibly specific states of mind that seem to line up with entire philosophical theories. This holds true for a number of transpersonal effects and is something that I\\'m deeply passionate about doing my absolute best to both document and discuss without descending into any degree of pseudoscience or hippy babble.[/p]\\n[/quote]',\n",
       " '[quote author=\"Josie Kins\" profile=\"Josie\"][p]Without any question or hesitation, I undoubtedly believe that this particular transpersonal effect is by far the most important and significant state of mind the psychedelic experience has to offer. I have been fascinated by this effect for around a decade now and first came to learn of its existence as a teenager through the numerous first hand accounts given to me by my close friends. This effect was further solidified in my mind as something of extreme significance after I found the works of Alan Watts through his philosophical lectures and writings. I then proceeded to dive headfirst into meditation and obsessively contemplating the supposedly illusory nature of the self on a daily basis. I even found that on more than one occasion, I could lead people into experiencing states of high level unity by simply saying the right words to them during heavy psychedelic trips.  [/p]\\n\\n[p]However, despite my borderline obsession with this subjective effect and its associated philosophical frameworks, I found that no matter how heavy a dosage of a psychedelic I consumed, I could never experience this state of mind for myself. This led me to the conclusion that regardless of how common an occurrence this effect was for many other experienced psychedelic users, my extreme fascination with it must be the exact thing that is preventing me from experiencing it for myself. This caused me to inevitably let my guard down for what was to come. Approximately two years later while under the influence of ayahuasca, I spontaneously found myself undergoing a state of level 4 unity for the first time in my life. This happened on two separate occasions within a month and, at the time, were by far the most profound and lifechanging psychedelic experiences I had ever undergone in my entire life. \\x0b\\x0b [/p]\\n\\n[p]In the years after these two experiences, I have since undergone states of unity on two other occasions, both of which were under the influence of 4-HO-MET and also less than a month apart. These experiences seemingly came out of nowhere and I cannot for the life of me understand or figure out any causal factors or correlations behind the triggering of this state of mind.  As far as I can tell, it seems that certain individuals are much more prone to it than others, but almost everybody will inevitably experience this if they trip regularly enough over a long period of time. It does not seem to be dependent on the dosage or the psychedelic in question, although set and setting seems to be at least somewhat of a factor. Situations involving beautiful nature, deep contemplation, and philosophical conversation can often cause it to come about, but not in a reliable or reproducible fashion. It therefore seems that states of unity and interconnectedness must arise organically and out of a situation in which the person either comes to a conclusion of their own accord, or perhaps where some subconscious process of the mind is allowed to independently arise in an autonomous manner. [/p]\\n\\n[p]At this point, I cannot deny that I personally believe the common conception of a separate self is merely a construct of human perception. In fact, I would go even further and state that based upon my extensive research, this widely held position is both philosophically and scientifically justifiable. However, I want to make it clear that I do not have any desire to convince people of that here. Instead, I simply aim to document the subjective experience of this perspective in a manner that is as comprehensive and reasonable as possible. This is with the hope that people far more intelligent than me can someday use this article as a template for furthering our collective understanding of this profound and absolutely fascinating state of mind.

       " '[subarticle id=\"stylevariations\" size=\"h5\"] [/subarticle][p]Depending on the person and the specific substance consumed, hallucinogenic geometry can manifest in an incredibly wide variety of aesthetic styles that are often subjectively interpreted quite differently between people. However, there are certain themes and descriptive terms that people commonly use to describe them. For example, many people will claim that LSD geometry looks synthetic and digital in style; however, in comparison, psilocybin geometry looks organic. Outside of this, other commonly used descriptive terms include but are not limited to: [i]natural, synthetic, digital, organic, mystical, cartoony, realistic, tribal, ancient, eldritch, sacred, hyperspatial, mechanical, cosmic, and alien[/i].[/p]\\n\\n[p]In terms of geometry\\'s less subjective potential stylistic differences, these can be broken down into the following variations:[/p]\\n\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Intricate\" b=\"Simple\"]Geometry can either present itself as incomprehensibly intricate and complex in its appearance or simplistic, basic and comprehensible even at higher doses. For example, the geometry associated with dissociatives tends to be consistently overly simplistic in form while most psychedelics produce significantly more intricate geometry.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Algorithmic\" b=\"Abstract\"]Algorithmic geometry can appear to follow mathematical rules and logically consistent forms in its design. This often results in high amounts of fractals and semi-predictable shapes. In contrast, geometry can also be completely abstract or random in its appearance in a way that contains an infinite amount of completely unpredictable variety.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Unstructured\" b=\"Structured\"]Geometry can either present itself as completely disorganized and unstructured across a 2-dimensional plane, or it can form and condense across the surfaces of a variety of 3-dimensional mechanical and ever-shifting structures.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Dimly lit\" b=\"Brightly lit\"]Geometry can either present itself as extremely dark and hard to make out from its background or, in contrast, can be brightly lit and extremely easy to distinguish from its background. For example, the geometry associated with dissociatives tends to be consistently darker in appearance while most psychedelic geometry is significantly brighter.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Multicoloured\" b=\"Monotone \"]The colour scheme of geometry can be extremely varied and multicoloured, or it can have little to no colour variety in a manner that is usually comprised of grays, purples and blacks.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Flat shading\" b=\"Glossy shading\"]The shading of geometry can either be flat, bright and simplistic, or it can be glossy with depth, gradients, highlights, and shading.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Sharp edges\" b=\"Soft edges\"]Geometry can have sharp edges which are extremely well-defined around the perimeter, sometimes with thick black outlines around their edges. In contrast, they can also be soft and blurred around the edges, merging seamlessly into each other in a manner which does not affect its intricacy.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Large\" b=\"Small\"]The size of geometry can either be extremely large and zoomed in, or it can be fine and zoomed out in a manner that does not affect its overall level of intricacy.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Fast\" b=\"Slow\"]In terms of its speed, geometry can shift and morph so fast into itself that the amount of information presented to the tripper in extremely short periods of time becomes very difficult to process. In contrast, geometry can move slowly and comprehensibly, gradually swirling and shifting into themselves to present forms that can be observed at a much higher level of detail.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Smooth\" b=\"Jittery\"]In terms of its motion, geometry can either move smoothly with a seemingly high frame rate, or it can be jittery in its motion with lag and a lower frame rate.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Round corners\" b=\"Angular corners\"]Geometry can either have mostly rounded and circular corners or mostly sharp corners with pointed and angular geometry.[/separated-textbox]\\n[separated-textbox a=\"Non-immersive\" b=\"Immersive\"]Non-immersive geometry can be manifested in front of one’s face in a manner that feels as if it was being presented on a screen without a distinct sense of size or distance attributed to it.

In contrast, progressive geometry can manifest in such a way that disturbances and sensory input such as bright lights, loud noises and distractions within the external environment will reset the intensity, complexity and visibility to a baseline level.
